elevator.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I was continually surprised after waiting for an elevator at how many stops we made for housekeeping to enter with carts, room service carts and trays, etc.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>How could Hyatt skip a service elevator on this new property?Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It really stinks at times.....its bad.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This one really surprised me, and i have traveled the world for more than 20 years staying in some of the finest hotels in the world.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Andaz is great, but it doesn't rank with many that i have had the pleasure of staying with.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It was half the cost....almost.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Honestly will have trouble staying at any other hotel in the NYC area.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>For those who stay at this hotel, there's always a chance at a celebrity sighting.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I stayed at the Setai for 3 nights last week, as my company reserved a block for us.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I have stayed at countless hotels in NYC and this is by far the best value.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My boss is very hard to impress and he has already mentioned he would like to book again next year.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My husband and I stayed at The Chatwal for 9 nights in April 2012.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We booked our rooms via booking.com.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It is just like the photos in the hotel website.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We thank Mr Mullins for all his help.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall a great 5-star boutique hotel experience in a very central NYC location.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Subway is two blocks away to all of Manhattan.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel also has a great view of the Empire State Building in rooms facing 6th Ave.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I was extremely satisfied with the my two night's stay and would stay again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I've stayed at 4 and 5 star hotels all over Manhattan.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Over the past year, however, I have returned each time to the Eventi.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Stayed at this hotel for four nights in December 2012.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>With regard the hotel itself, we were very happy with out choice.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel has two lifts servicing all floor, and we never had to wait for a lift.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel was very very good.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Only slight critique would be the night life tends to close around 11pm in the immediate area.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We chose the San Carlos based on reviews in T.A and were not disappointed.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Near to subway for added convenience.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It is a great hotel to walk from/to as one gets the full flavor of 5th Avenue.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This is one of the best and my favorite swanky hotel in New York City.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>If you've never stayed at the Sherry Netherland I suggest you try it.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Loved the hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Lovely subtle green decor and room large for NYC standards.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Next to the lift is an info desk where you could get a map of NYC.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Good bottle shop next door to hotel as well.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Our first stay on the upper west side and can't say enough good things about the Hotel Beacon.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed here based on reviews of family friendly hotels.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>There weren't any special programs for kids, but we did see other families there.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Parking garage is right around the corner -- very close.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Very convenient to American Museum of Natural History -- easy to catch a cab or subway.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We will definitely stay here again and very happy to recommend.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Great room, very big with huge bed!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Great location, just one block's walk from 72nd subway then 5 minute ride to Times Square and anywhere you want to go from there!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Very close to Central Park, check out Cafe Viand for sit down breakfast and Fairway and Levain Bakery for take away breakfast.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Great all in all!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed at this property in October for a week.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The market across the street was handy for breakfast items and snacks.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Only a couple short blocks to the 72nd Street subway.station, where you can pick up the 1,2 and 3 trains.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Definitely recommended.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Lovely little hotel with great views of the library.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The room was very quiet.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I could not hear anyone from other rooms, the hallway or any street noise.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I also loved the overall vibe of the hotel; small, hip, clean, and friendly.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Not warm and cozy though.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was young and not as experienced as one would find at a five-star hotel but this is not a five-star hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Easy walk from here to Grand Central Station to hop the subway and cabs easy to find.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>All in all though, my memories are of a great stay.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Other hotels in NYC that are space challenged would do well to take note of what Hyatt has done with its two Andaz properties here.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My wife and I arrived at 10am on a Saturday morning and the hotel had been sold out the night before.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Except for that, the hotel is a 5 all around.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Would definitely recommend highly.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I'd never heard of this hotel, but came away a big fan!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>On every visit to NYC, the Hotel Beacon is the place we love to stay.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>So conveniently located to Central Park, Lincoln Center and great local restaurants.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Just returned from a 4 day/3 night long weekend in NYC with wife and two (late teenage) sons.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed at The Setai and loved it.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Recently it seems room prices have become very high unfortunately.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I stayed at the Chatwel on a layover in NYC.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Travelers can always trust a Luxury Collection Hotel to deliver great service, comfortable accomodations and quality products.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>If you like midtown and can afford this hotel it is great.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Arrived to Eventi in the evening from Montreal.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Touched with the visit to the 911 memorial site.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Best thrill was still the skating time on the rockefeller rink with all the Xmas decoration.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I made the best travel decision I have ever made by choosing the eventi.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It's a little far from the theatre district, but very central and easy access to the subway.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The fitness area is more than adequate.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We preferred quiet to a view, so rooms facing west were very quiet.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The room was exceptionally quiet.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>But the neighborhood is pretty dreary -- not unsafe, but unattractive, convenient only to Penn Station/Madison Square Garden, and in the middle of a retail district offering cheap wholesale handbags and jewelry.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Next time, I'll choose a better location.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location is also hard to beat being close to broadway, the subway and reasonably close to Central Park.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel would suit a couple who only intend to use it as a base and don't intend spending much time there but being in NYC that's not hard to do.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>A positive experience overall.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Only complaint, the resturant is over-priced!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Our annual trip to NYC this year I selected the Iroquois - look no further - its so perfect.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Can't wait to go again next year.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My husband and I stayed here with our good friend while visiting NYC for a Broadway show.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The San Carlos hotel is conveniently located to many of the common tourist sites, including Times Square and the Theater District.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, this hotel is a great value for the price, great location, wonderful service, and very clean rooms.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The San Carlos Hotel had the best rate this time, in the midst of the craziness with the holiday time, and it was a nice place to stay.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It was quiet and had a comfortable bed so I'd stay again if the price was right!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>After alot of trawling for a fab place to stay this was perfect.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Location walkable to times square, 5th avenue and close to tube stations.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We would stay again if we are to come back to NYC.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I stayed this time only one night at the San Carlos hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Certainly You'll see me back again for business and leisureHotel</td></tr><tr><td>The information about the Sherry-Netherland is very misleading.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Then there are the elevator attendants, a number of immigrant men who stand around with very little to keep them occupied.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>After all, I can press a button in an elevator without any help.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I’ve seen much better hotels that cost much less money.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Who ever gave this place 4 ½ stars?Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Yes, I realize that one pays for location and that I rented ‘only’ a room and not a suite but, as a regular visitor to New York, I am never staying at the Sherry- Netherland again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We loved our stay at the Sherry.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I hope we have an opportunity to stay there again soon!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I stayed at the Sherry during my last 4-day business trip to NYC.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The elevators are operated by \"white-glove elevator attendants\", which felt like a little treat every time I went up or down.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Every morning I ordered room service from Cipriani's, the restaurant attached to the hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>One evening the neighbours were making quite a lot of noise, and I called down to the concierge at midnight.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>In the evenings, someone would come to turn down the bed, and leave little Godiva chocolate squares throughout the room.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I loved it, and would not hesitate to go back again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My sister and I decided to meet in NYC and chose the Sherry for its excellent location.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Room service was expensive but excellent quality.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>But what really makes the hotel is the service.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We go to New York every year and this is where we stay every time.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is beautiful and clean.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It is always very quiet.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I love that there is a market across the street and there are many great places to eat and have drinks nearby!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed in the Hotel Beacon for a week in late October and found it to be a very good hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This is a \"family\" hotel - nice and quiet with a relaxed air about it.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We will definitely stay here again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>stayed here for 4 nights in December.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It is a great hotel, based in the upper East side, 5 minutes walk from central park.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My partner and I stayed here from 6th December - 10th December and had one of the best holidays ever!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The area of the hotel was ideal for us as it allowed us to see many of the New York attractions whilst keeping away from the hustle and bustle that many midtown hotels would experience.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel itself is about a 10 minute walk from Central Park, however a 30/40 minute walk to many midtown attractions eg.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I would advise the city bus tour which was $54 dollars per person as it allows you to see all of the main tourist attractions and helps you find your bearings (especially first timers)Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Our overall experience of the beacon hotel and New York as a whole is 10 out of 10.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I could not recommend the hotel enough!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Would go there again!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>City noise does filter in--not bad but bring ear plugs just in case this bothers you.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Location is excellent: very close to Grand Central Station and tons of eating and shopping options.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>First stay at the Andaz and I was quite impressed.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location is amazing!!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Other than that highly recommended.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I'll definitely stay here again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I absolutely LOVED this hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I will definitely come back to this hotel whenever I travel to New york and I will, without any hesitation,book through deryk and I highly recommend anyone who books with this hotel to do the same.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>For a recent business trip to NY, one of my colleagues recommended this hotel as he always stays here.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location is great if you are a tourist, and happily was within a short walk of the client I was visiting.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>i have never written a review before, i must let you all know that if you choose to stay here you are NOT in for a treat, it's all bad............Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights during thanksgiving.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is in a great location close to all the shops, theatres, Times Square & restaurants.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The photos on the website are very flattering.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I would definitely return here.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed at the Eventi the first week in December, a particularly hard week to find a hotel in NYC.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is centrally located and we walked from Penn Station and walked to Bryant Park which is beautiful around Christmastime.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall we had a great stay!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Having stayed at the Ink 48 a few years ago on returning to NYC i figured to try another Kimpton hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>So full of expectation and a hard act to follow i arrived at the hotel and i was not disappointed.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel itself if in a great location.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Just returned to the UK following a 4 night stay at the Eventi.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel location is fantastic.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Very close to the Empire State - fantastic views from the hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It's around a 10 min walk to Times Square and very close to the Subway station.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Just what you need after a long day sightseeing.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Loved this hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Really really impressed and will definitely go back.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It was convenient to lots of spots in New York City and the hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The elevator in the hotel is a little slow but we stayed on the 3rd floor and took the stairs.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel had a very home like feel and I would definitely stay there again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The Iroquois is a beautiful hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I chose it because of it's location to Times Square & 5th Avenue and because it also got good reviews here.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>As I mentioned, the hotel is close to everything.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Thumbs up Iroquois... we will be back.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This was our first stay at the Iroquois Hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We loved it!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It was GREAT!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We would surely stay here again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The quiet elegance of the hotel was comforting against the hustle and bustle of the city!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed at the San Carlos for 5 days over Thanksgiving and it was just perfect.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>You feel confortable in the middle of town, next to the train, the museums and the big avenues of New York.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We recently stayed at the Sherry with my husband's parents - for my father in law's 80th birthday.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel offers more of a \"residence\" feel than a standard hotel, and the locations is unbeatable - across the street from Central Park, in the heart of Fifth Avenue shopping, and within walking distance to Rockfeller Center and Times Square (if you enjoy walking).Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Room service is available at Cipriani downstairs, and we used it for breakfast, which was good - although the breakfast cutoff hours and staff at Cipriani were not ideal - no fault of the Sherry though, as they are not under the same management and operate independently.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We loved our stay at the Sherry overall and hope to be back soon!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Central Park to escape to and breathe...with many attractions within near or around the park....strawberry fields, walk trails, the lakes, zoo and gardens plus perimeter shopping and museum mile and much more... subway on the corner....and a fifth avenue address....uptown living at its best.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall oustanding Sherry Netherland.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Despite small negative issues we very much enjoyed the stay and can honestly recommend the hotel to others.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>From the first night we stayed at this hotel, both my husband and myself have been itching like crazy!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This hotel is PERFECT FOR BACKPACKERS WHO HAVE MONEY!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My bf and I go to New York quite regularly, and this time choose the Chatwal hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>One of the most memorable was when in the elevator, and Brandon took the time to talk to my bf about his glasses, and how he had the same one.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location was very close to Times Square, so that was convenient, but isolated so the noise and traffic would not affect your stay.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Our four night stay was quite pleasant, however you get what you pay for, and the Chatwal is pricey.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Thank you Chatwal for our excellent stay, and will definitely consider you again for our destination hotel in NYC.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My wife and I stayed in four hotels in our recent trip across the US and this was our favourite.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location is great and was one of our key reasons for choosing Eventi.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel and location were worth it.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>After being in many hotels around the world, there is no other place like the Iroquois!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We will definitely choose and recommend others to choose the Iroquois as their Midtown Manhattan hotel!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We look forward to staying there again!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Lovely hotel in a great location.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is right in the heart of the theatre district, restaurants and shopping, minutes from Times Square and an easy walk to Central Park.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The Sherry is my home away from home.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Was a experience to remember.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Great place to stay and place to be for a visit while in new york city... ,ALSO look forward to going back in the near future and making the sherry netherlands hotel my honeymoon stay...BE...The sherry netherlands hotel and staff made me and my lady feel very welcome to be there....Thank you all againHotel</td></tr><tr><td>My wife found a room at the San Carlos Hotel in Midtown with only one night available.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>After 2yrs planning 3 friends and I left the husbands and kids at home in Ireland and headed to NYC for 4 nights of relaxation, sightseeing and shopping.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We arrived Sat 27th and Sandy arrived Monday 29th so our NYC adventure became somewhat curtailed.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We weren't sure what to expect as we went off of reviews from here and viewed picturs uploaded by others on this website.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location was amazing - it was a 4 min walk to Times Square.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>When we return to NYC, we will be staying here again!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Eventi in New York.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I would stay here again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Took a Veterans Day weekend trip to The Chatwal for our anniversary.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Little pricey, but it's a nifty hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It's right off Times Square, so location is good for most things.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Unfortunately, next door were three single guys having a weekend in the city and the noise was unreal.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Like they were standing right next to you talking in your ear while you were trying to sleep.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>So we got to participate when they got room service at 2 a.m. when they got up at 8:30 and then again when the maids came in to clean at 9.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Not out of sync for this level in NYC, but the St. Regis was on the same point level and I can't say I think it's better than that.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Bottom line--if you're looking for something retro and cool, it's great.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>If you need something more modern or a lot of space, probably not for you.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Our first trip to NY City in a few years and the first time we stayed at the Chatwal which we decided to stay in due to it's proximity to Broadway and a friend's recommendation.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Finally, the location, we booked to see a broadway show and were there in less than two minutes, it's right in the heart of Times Square which offered numerous choices of eating and drinking establishments.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The Chatwal is not cheap but worth every penny.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>AMAZING HOTEL!!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This is the 3RD time i stay here!!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>definitely the only hotel i would stay at in new york!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I also made a reservation for my husband and i at the spa in the hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>one of the BEST spas i have ever been to.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>After our treatments we paid and they again wished us a happy Anniversary and walked us down to the elevator pushed the button and contented to talk to us, going above and beyond to make us feel at home here at the hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>i would stay at this hotel a million times and i will be recommending it to my friends and family.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed here in May 2011 to attend a friend's wedding.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My husband and I took a red eye from SFO and we planned on meeting my sister, brother in law, 5 month old nephew, and their dog who had driven up from VA. We stayed in a two bedroom suite with views of the library, Bryant Park, Empire State Building, and a glimpse of Times Square.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is trendy and modern and yet it feels cozy.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>All in all, very strange and completely unnecessary.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Planned a long weekend last week in NYC; Arrived in hectic rush hour from JFK at the Andaz 5th avenue and were welcomed in their slick hotel lobby and immediately upgraded upon check-in to a two bedroom suite, with separate bathrooms and a livingroom, which allowed for discrete privacy for all three travellers;Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Agree with the considered 5* service level, hotel key amenities are:Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>- Cool and chic designHotel</td></tr><tr><td>- Central design @ 5th avenue opposite Library and 2 blocks from Grand CentralHotel</td></tr><tr><td>- Nice restaurant with excellent breakfast á la carte menuHotel</td></tr><tr><td>- Bar downstairs with good vibe for cocktails and tapas style foodHotel</td></tr><tr><td>- Small gym but with modern equipmentHotel</td></tr><tr><td>We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Beacon.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location is great....we liked being in a \"neighborhood\" and love the tree-lined side streets and brownstone homes nearby.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>In just a few blocks of walking (less than 5 minutes) you can be at a subway stop.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I would definitely recommend Hotel Beacon for all kinds of travelers.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Great hotel for New York.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Not happy at all.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My best friend and I went to NYC in August last year and spent 2 weeks at Hotel Beacon.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall - A great hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Would definitely recommend it to friends and family :)Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Great location in Midtown.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I was in Houston on business and stayed at this Best Western from 12/3-12/7; best experience on business travel I have ever had.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This Best Western location exceeded any expectations that I had.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>If I'm ever in Houston again I will be staying at this location!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Lots of parking available.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Cheap cab ride back, although it is walkable.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Other facilities include vending machines and the pool/spa area appeared well maintained although we didn’t use it.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We had an issue with the prepayment of the room through a third party website which could have been dealt with better but overall this hotel is very good for a Houston visit.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The Hilton Americas is a very nice hotel that I will choose to stay in again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The fitness center is great, very large, well appointed, and also has great views.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is within easy walking distance of the convention center, the Toyota Center, shopping, Discovery Green, and groceries at Phoenicia Specialty Foods.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I had to work over the holidays and took my family with me since My trip was one week (over Thanksgiving).Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This hotel was the best!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The infinity pool and pool deck is amazing - boasts beautiful sunsets in the evening.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is close to shopping, a large children's park, very nice restaurants and grocery shopping and eats at a wonderful spot called the Phoenician (sp?)Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>They have a gym with several bikes, elipticals, etc.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>They have a pretty good selection, but maybe a little overpriced.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>They have a small bar with TV's in the restaurant area.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>That is why I would stay at this hotel again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This hotel is a gem, old world charm, beautiful appointed rooms, stunning location right across the road from Central Park and 10 minutes walk to Times Square, 7 of us stayed in 3 rooms and all thoroughly enjoyed our stay.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Perfectly located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Central Park!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My husband and I stayed at the Sherry for two weeks and I wanted this “hotel” to be excellent as per the ratings on TA.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We had just come from two weeks at The Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca which was fantastic.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>There is no pool to go sit by.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We are checked in by the concierge and given a nice welcome until she looks at my passport photo and tells me how much I have aged.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>In fact, during the whole two week stay we did not actually hear much of the renovation going on, it is what woke us up each morning.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My tip to the Sherry, if your guest has the “do not disturb” sign up and the paper is still outside their door it indicates they are still asleep.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Now there are plenty more examples to provide but the piece de resistance was room service.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>He rings room service and orders one each.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>So with this experience in mind, go to a proper hotel, a place that provides the amenities a hotel of five star standard should.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed a two-night stay the San Carlos hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The room was very quiet so I slept well.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>At $275 for the night, I would definitely stay there again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed at the San Carlos Hotel for two nights last month.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel was in a great location and the subway is around the corner.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>No complaints would definitely consider a return visit when back in NYC.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Finally settled on the San Carlos based on a recommendation.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>What a great choice!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Clean, mostly quiet ( hard not to heat street noise in NYC, right?).Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Close to Times Square and the Theatre District, and, of course, shopping!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I would definitely stay at the San Carlos again!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>During Sandy, the hotel was ran in the most efficient way.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>needed staff stayed over and was extremely nice to everyone (given the numbers of ppl that walked in...)Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>for me as a frequent traveler, there's only one hotel in NYC - The San Carlos !Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, a great experience and will definitely stay there again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Clean and friendly and great location...a gem.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed at the Eventi Kimpton Hotel for 7 nights at the end of November.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We would recommend this hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>There is also good security at the hotel as in the evening there was always a security guard on the door.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location of the hotel is great - close to the Empire State building, shops and the subway.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall a great stay at a great hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I am currently staying at the Eventi during an adventurous business trip that's taking me from California, to Texas to DC and back again to New York.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Nothing is too much trouble... A rare and precious commodity to the well worn traveller...Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>In one word... exceptional :)Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Great location for theaters and even a short walk to the Park.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Small but adequate fitness center, pool, and hot tub shares the same space as the Red Door Spa.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Chatwal.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>They met our every need and then some!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Location is fantastic - we were there for theatres, galleries, and shopping, and being near Times Square is fantastic.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I would happily stay here again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We checked into this hotel when our home lost electricity and heat post Sandy.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel was very accommodating to our needs (we have a dog and a baby).Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We redeemed SPG points for the stay.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Not sure if it'a worth the rack rate.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I love the location (37th & 5th; Garment Dist same stores less crowded) because it's a nice retreat from hustle & bustle of Times Square/Midtown but still close to everything.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Baffled at what others mean about the prices being higher; don't think it even compares.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We will definitely be back (soon!).Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This is a place that can't decide whether it wants to be an apartment building or a hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The pricing is among the highest in the city.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I value service,and the little touches that make a stay special, and this place is not in the league of the Ritz Carlton Central Park, the Mandarin Oriental, the Peninsula and others.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The gym was lacking.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>But the rest of the stay, mainly to do with the service, was disappointing, and thus I wouldn't pay the premium prices again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I was here for five nights in August for a holiday.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I was able to use the Maserati four times during my stay.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>All in all, I'd definitely stay here again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This is my first stay in an Andaz hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I very much prefer it to W. It is not as gimmicky.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I would have no hesitation at all to stay here again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Superb location in mid town on 5th Ave.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I thought the location of the hotel was excellent, directly across from the library in the Bryant Park district.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Very unusual and unique for a boutique hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>If the location sounds appealing, I would highly recommend the Andaz.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Located about 2 blocks from 42nd Street and 5th Avenue, which is the center of New York City, the location could not be better.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Anyway, back to the Andaz 5th Avenue, everything was splendid from start to finish!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I am very noise sensitive, and this is always a worry when I am in a hotel, and no matter how quiet it was in my room I never heard anything!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>On to a perfect night's sleep.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>And that is the kind of service the Andaz 5th Avenue gives!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Situated directly across the street from the NY public library in a renovated retail building, the location and service can't be beat.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Its entrance on 41st is almost hidden.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>An excellent stay, I highly recommend the Andaz Fifth Ave.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Regular visitor of this hotel,i believe is the best hotel in the best location...simple,clean,not crazy expensive,not noisy ,with great beds!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>and near to all the attractions that i wanted to visit.We always take the 1 bedroom suite,has a living room,a small kitchinette and a large bedroom.Very good value for money!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We just returned from NYC after staying at the Beacon.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>What an unexpected delight.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Wonderful location near Columbus circleHotel</td></tr><tr><td>The Beacon is well located, 2 blocks to subway, an easy walk to Central Park and midtown.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Picked this hotel primarily for its location, convenient to family here in Houston.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>As our week-long stay progressed, I realized that in every aspect of our stay, this hotel exceeded our expectations.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>All in all, this turned out to be a great vacation, thanks Best Western!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I'm awarding this Best Western 5 stars as it met all my expectations in terms of price, brand, room etc.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location is very convenient to downtown Houston, University of Houston, Rice, Galleria, etc..Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I must say I really enjoyed my stay here!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Very close to downtown without the downtown prices.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed the free parking!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The Hilton Americas Houston is a very nice hotel and probably one of the nicest Hilton hotels in the country.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>All of the facilities are top notch including the lobby, the executive lounge, and the fitness center and spa, which are located on the 23rd floor of the hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is connected by a bridge to the convention center and the Hilton's conference rooms and spaces are all very nice and well appointed.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>They have three floors of ballrooms and meeting spaces.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Things really are bigger in Texas.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location is right in the thick of everything downtown Houston.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Parking is $19.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, outstanding customer service.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I always stay at this Hilton Garden Inn when I travel to Houston due to close proximity to my company headquarter and still relatively easy to get to downtown Houston and the Galleria.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I stayed here from June 2012 thru October 2012 for business.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I certainly had a great time.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I'd like to extend whomever is looking for a great place with excellent service, and with wonderful restaurants at walking distance, come on down and see for yourselves this hidden gem of a place.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I'm currently a guest resident at the extended stay america and I must say it as been a pleasure to be here.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I would recommend this property for anyone coming for an extended stay or for a night or two.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>If you need a place to stay in the Northwest area of Houston, I HIGHLY recommend Extended Stay America on Hollister.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Can't recommend this hotel enough.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It is in fact quite reasonably priced.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed three nights, using a hotel offer of a free third night.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Not worth spending this amount of money for mediocre service.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>A former bank building, this hotel did a great job with renovations.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The elevators are original to the building and are a bit on the small side, but that is to be expected.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My key wasn't working in the elevator and I ended up seeing five different floors before I could make it back down to the lobby to get a new room key.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>In fact, Downtown Houston seemed pretty desolate on the weekends.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>If I would ever return to Houston, I would definitely stay here.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I'm a big fan of Marriott.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>But this Marriott property makes you want to go somewhere else.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My family had several rooms for a wedding weekend.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>A nice physical redo of an old bank, management seems to be challenged to have services which match.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I can only think that the rental price for the Hospitality Suite was much more than our guest suite as no additional solutions to the problem were offered.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The whole experience was frustrating.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed here after a Christmas party and the room was very enjoyable and trendy.This location was difficult to find and currently has construction next door during the daytime.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We slept in and woke up to the construction outside late in the morning.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>A live band played in the evening.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, great stay.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel Sorella in a great location.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Walking distance to terrific restaurants/bars/shops.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Would recommend for event planners.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, however, very good hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I will admit that I stumbled upon this hotel and sure glad that I did!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Hilton created a partnership with the College of Hospitality at the University of Houston and as a result the hotel is both a teaching ground as well as a platform of perfection.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Located just a few exits from downtown the hotel is amazingly easy to access on and off hwy 45.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>There is not a question that I will be staying at this hotel every visit to Houston I have!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I stayed twice in this hotel while on a business trip in Houston.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered room service and really enjoyed it.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The gym downstairs has good equipment, but is a little claustrophobic...Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Had breakfast in the attached restaurant: good service but expensive (~20 dollars).Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall the hotel is very good but for 400-500 dollars it is way too expensive, even considering that it's NYC.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The S/N is at the perfect location in the city, everything is walkable or the subway is around the corner if you want to go that way.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>They charge the usual NYC prices, but watch for specials and you will do OK.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The accomodations are great - overall a most pleasant experience.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>My husband found this hotel on the internet and after reading the Tripadvisor reviews, we booked our stay for 3 nights in Midtown NYC.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is central and in a calm street.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I have experienced both the studio and the one bedroom units.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>All have been recently renovated.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed here for three nights for our oldest daughter's wedding at nearby Holy Rosary Chruch.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is close to downtown, but far enough away to avoid the traffic and noise.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This is a really nice hotel, a BW Plus, so it is closer to a higher priced chain than the normal BW.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location to downtown cannot be beat.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, this was a great experience and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>A two-night stay here for work was a great experience.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel's location, less than five minutes' drive from downtown, but at half the cost, was great.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, no complaints at all, and I'd certainly stay here again on a future trip to Houston.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Was in Houston for work and stayed here, this is truly one of the top Hilton's I have ever stayed at.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I highly recommend this hotel if you are in HoustonHotel</td></tr><tr><td>It is so nice to come home for a long season of business travel, but this hotel was like coming home.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Stayed 2 nights recently during a conference.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is a typical Hilton - which is to say very nice.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Otherwise, this part of Houston leaves alot to be desired.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Room service was the one disappointment.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>There is self-parking for $19 a day or valet for about twice that.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Self -park ...it is in a garage that is connected by a walkway.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Stayed here for a few nights last week, it is much as before.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Guess my rating is 3.5 but think it falls short of very good for reasons given.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>If you're on a long-term business trip in Houston, make sure you're at this Hilton, because they'll make sure that you're comfortable and well care for.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I was there for six weeks from mid-March through early May and the entire staff did their best to provide the comforts of home for me.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Any time that there was an issue - and there are always minor issues at any hotel, especially during a stay that lone - they fixed it pronto - and that's really what counts.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It's not about perfection, it's about dedication and commitment to guest comfort and wellbeing, and the Hilton Garden Inn on Katy Freeway is the place to stay for that in Houston.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Would definitely stay here again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I travel alot with my job and vacationing with my wife on our Harley Davidson.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It is my second time here and It has been a very gratefull experience to Stay here, quick, friendly and helpfull service, answer to all my questions with nice attitude, nice rooms, overall the kitchen, I have never seen in my country a service like this, is like be at home, with all those things, is very helpfull, you can save money there, you can cook, watch tv, swin in the pool, wash yopur clothes, do excersise, have a light breakfast in the morning, all this for the same price, it really worth the value.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Even though this whole establishment was completely booked, it was pleasant none the less to stay here.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I will be more than happy to stay here again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Everything you want and expect in a first-class hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This hotel continues to be one of our very favorites!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The workout facility is very nice & open 24/7 and the employees treat you like valued guests.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I've been in Houston quarterly for the past 14 years and the group I'm with has used several hotels over that period, usually near IAH as most of us travel in.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The Four Seasons is one of the more comfortable places I've stayed in and especially well set up for our group (pushing 90 people at each board meeting).Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I'd be pressed to call Houston a beautiful city with a charming ambiance, nor is the hotel itself an interesting structure, but the guest rooms are well decorated, nicely sized and have excellent bedding, especially in the case of the small suites to which I'm occasionally upgraded.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Looking to stay in Houston Texas!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>If you are on business or pleasure, or as in our case doing both the the Four Seasons in Downtown Houston is perfect.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We are here over \"Thanks Giving\" and it is quite a site to see.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>If you need a great Hotel in Houston Texas, then this Hotel should be on the list to check out.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Would recommendHotel</td></tr><tr><td>We both agreed that the bed was one of the most comfortable either of us had ever slept in; additionally, the room and hallways were quiet.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, we had a very good stay and would definitely return.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>It was AMAZING!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We would highly recommend it!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Our room overlooked the pool and the main City Centre square.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We will definitely stay here again!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Great location in City Center.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Right in the middle of tons of shopping, dining and entertainment.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Campus hotels are a little unpredictable, but this one is a star.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I was on a bussiness trip , it was a great experience.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The noise level is low for being in midtown.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The quick taxi ride to or from Grand Central is only about $5.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>All in all, would recommend this hotel for not only those associated with the UH campus, but for any travelers who want a nice place to stay for a reasonable amount of money.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We really didn't have a bad experience, but this hotel does have some ends to tie up before we would return.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Valet parking available, but also can self park in a covered garage connected to hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I was booked at this property by accident, and I am now a repeat customer.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Parking is very cheap and the hotel is extremely secure.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Thank you all for such a pleasant stay!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location was perfect, it is in the middle of the U of H campus, but had easy parking in the parking garage.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I try to stay at the Iroquois when I am in NY for business.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Bottom line: I recommend it highly and will certainly stay here again.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I have stayed in this hotel before many times.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This time I saw major difference.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I think everything expect location.Just locationHotel</td></tr><tr><td>Close proximity to airport.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>For the value of money it is good bet.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>the ventilation in long corridors should be improved to avoid damp algal smell.locationHotel</td></tr><tr><td>There is nothing but a building.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Very nice swimming pool on roof but sun loungers needs new covers.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel rooms were a little old, the fitness centre and pool smallNice hotel, great Security, friendly staff, nice breakfastHotel</td></tr><tr><td>Good place to spend the night in between flights.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>They did not refund money for one day earlier checkout citing reason online booking.AmbianceHotel</td></tr><tr><td>As per moneyNot good as per money last time they give me good room but this time not worth itHotel</td></tr><tr><td>No complainsMy preferred hotel in MumbaiHotel</td></tr><tr><td>Very near to domestic airport.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I think the hotel inside is too dark all over.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>we did not get what exactly was assured to us while making the payment and booking.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>!.Great location, food and services!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Close to airport which was all we needed.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>.and life secure and be comfortable.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>..Very beautiful...Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Great location...Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Old property.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>A typical business hotel type services.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Like value for money rooms.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Not worth the cost.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Just ok.Excallent location for a transit traveller.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>They do not allow visitors in the room which hampers work etc.Would not like to stay next time because of this restrictions.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Things were way way overpriced for no reason!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Nothing specificLocation and ambianceHotel</td></tr><tr><td>It is a bit worn out, needs some renovation in the rooms.It is an impressive location.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Deluxe room was dated.Nice pool, close to domestic terminal.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Gym is too small in a cramped room.close proximity to AirportHotel</td></tr><tr><td>That the true cost was hidden by all the added extras.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Service of 4 starRate just right for 4 starHotel</td></tr><tr><td>Parking is a major nuisance, because of the location.Very warm service, especially the Bell Captain, Wesley.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Some staff

from domestic airport and international airport is also not far.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Very close to airport.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Great lobby area.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The property is definitely not suitable to be featured as 5 star given the current status of the rooms and amenities which is overdue for a complete refurbishment.The property is located fairly close to the airport.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>This hotel is no way near 5 star standard this should 3 star ratedStaff was welcomingHotel</td></tr><tr><td>Everything....everyone was exceptionally great!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>From the Valet to Club Prive to All the Restaurants....absolutely warm good feeling of a eco friendly atmosphere....Truly a wonderful experience after

a 3 star hotel...the staff are less than professional and feels like they are related to the owner or from the same community ,a distinct lack of professionalism is apparent.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td> at allHotel</td></tr><tr><td>This is a good hotel.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Walking distance from the Santa Cruz airport.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The entire experienceHotel</td></tr><tr><td>Hopeless Stay.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Absolutely unorganized.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Will never get back to this place again in my life.Nothing!Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Very conveniently

experience from start to finish was simply amazing.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed in the hotel for 3 days.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I have stayed in this hotel for couple of times and it is perfect in

one girl who checked in us to the hotel)Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Quite a confusing layout, with poor signage.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>I'm not sure the lift to the 7th floor actually exists!Good location, near CSI AirportHotel</td></tr><tr><td>It was good but MAP was not provided .Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Remarkable difference compared to one or two years back.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The location and the

close to domestic and internetional air port clean and good hotelHotel</td></tr><tr><td>Room service is too expensive.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Ambience of the hotelHotel</td></tr><tr><td>I do not recommend for business.Big room.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Near to airport.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>All was good .Hotel is excellent value for money.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>The place is very lively and friendlyHotel</td></tr><tr><td>its expensivelocationHotel</td></tr><tr><td>Surprisingly over charged.Stayed in one night only.the breakfast at boulevard was excellent.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>Approach to the hotel from main road with shanty town type hokker stalls and shabby structures.Hotel</td></tr><tr><td>- Big rooms, very cleanHotel</td></tr><tr><td>- Small pool, jacuzzi and gymHotel</td></tr><tr><td>It is fabulous to have the kitchen with cooking facilities and the access to a whole range of fresh foods directly across the road at Fairway.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Lemon poppy-seed pancakes are must haves at the restaurant.FB</td></tr><tr><td>One of the best pancakes ever.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The kitchenette was a nice touch with a stocked fridge offering complimentary non-alcoholic beverages and snacks, dishes and utensils, a sink, dishwasher, and a microwave.FB</td></tr><tr><td>They have daily Happy Hour(s) where you can get a complimentary decent glass of wine in the modest Lobby Lounge and bring it to your room.FB</td></tr><tr><td>One suggestion is to offer selections of cheese and crackers platters to go with that wine.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The restaurant off the lobby was very pricey for breakfast (+$20 per entree).FB</td></tr><tr><td>When you can get a decent breakfast within a block or two of the hotel for under $10, what can I say?FB</td></tr><tr><td>Every room has a fridge with complimentary soft drinks, snacks, water, sparkling water, milk and juices.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast at the Andaz ranks above almost anything i have ever paid.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Apparently, i had a $190.00 breakfast for two the first morning, and $175.00 the second.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Eggs for each, coffee, berries.FB</td></tr><tr><td>I just had breakfast this morning for 2 at the Four Seasons NYC.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We had drinks at the Lambs Club bar nearly every night with our friends and were very happy with everything.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We had dinner at the Lambs Club restaurant downstairs and were very pleased.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We did not have breakfast at the hotel as there are a lot of alternatives close by.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Numerous classic eateries within walking distance.FB</td></tr><tr><td>In the morning it was full of coffee, with cups available for you to take out with you.FB</td></tr><tr><td>And from the afternoon onwards, hot cider was available.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast was basic but perfectly acceptable, lovely fresh continental breakfast, decent coffee, fruit juices, yoghurts.FB</td></tr><tr><td>You can eat as much as you like and grab a coffee before you head into New York.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Wonderful bar and restaurants.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Kitchenette was handy to eat breakfast in.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We did cook a few evening meals but were limited with cutlery!FB</td></tr><tr><td>It had an amazing variety of produce as well as ready cooked meals.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Didn't use the kitchen for our overnight stay but definitely would in the future.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Viand diner downstairs was OK for dinner -- not great but sufficient.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The complimentary drinks and snacks were a plus.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great and snacks in the rooms was a nice touch.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We also loved the complimentary snacks and beverages in the mini frig, as well as in the lounge.FB</td></tr><tr><td>and loved the complimentary wine in the evening!FB</td></tr><tr><td>Superb service, tasty (but expensive drinks) at the bar, and a terrific Times Square location make the Chatwal hard to beat.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Have a meal at the lambs club resturant and gaze at all the historic photo's of days gone by and the starts of Broadway that used to frequent the joint.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Not only did they have a bottle of champagne in the room for our big weekend but at every turn they were respectable and completely accommodating.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The lobby offers hot coffee/tea/cocoa in the morning and 2 newspapers (WSJ & NYTimes).FB</td></tr><tr><td>Prices for food and services seemed a little steep (not sure how they compare with other hotels in the city) but we found a diner only a few doors down which had good food at good prices.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We paid over $60 for 2 bowls of oatmeal, 2 orders of toast, 1 yougart, coffee and tea.FB</td></tr><tr><td>With 20% tip, our breakfast was $78.01.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast: there was an argument about whether or not I was allowed to order the continental breakfast, being first told no and later told yes.FB</td></tr><tr><td>And then there was the issue with the eggs.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Even when I told them how many minutes to boil the eggs, the cook could not do the eggs even half way cooked to wear I asked.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The location is perfect and doors away is the cutest little diner that serves a great brealfast.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The darker style rooms were a blessing for resting and the breakfast is a nice touch that it's free but as been said before don't worry if you miss it.FB</td></tr><tr><td>It was good to have tea/coffee fascilities in the room.FB</td></tr><tr><td>the Indian restaurant next door is also worth a visit.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Furthermore, an in-room kitchen is pictured among the hotel photos, which lead me to believe that I could expect this amenity.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The omlette was delicious, and filling out my breakfast form the night before, and hanging it on my door knob, quickly became a ritual.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The kitchen was an added bonus as there is a Supermarket across the way where you can get a wide range of food.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The food here is just excellent (breakfast and room service); I would eat here even if i was not staying here.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Sarah at the bar served us a specialty cocktail from the menu and it's now one of my favorite drinks, I just hope my bartender at home can make them as well as she did!FB</td></tr><tr><td>delayed check in (computers were down), entered a dark, gloomy room to a horrible musty odor, had a quick lunch in resaurant before a show..........the food was inedible, overly salted and greasy.......requested soymilk for my coffee that curdled as i poured it.FB</td></tr><tr><td>the waiter said \"their brand does that, pour it slowly and stir briskly\"......needless to say, i didn't take his advise!FB</td></tr><tr><td>besides, the coffee was so stong that it tasted like acid...expected much more from a top chef restaurant, geoffrey zakarian, where are you????FB</td></tr><tr><td>The food is really good and the rooms very spacious for New York.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We particularly loved the restaurant manager, Tim, who took great care of us and was so funny and attentive to us.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Oh and it was my birthday so they nicely left us a note and some cupcakes in the room, which was great!FB</td></tr><tr><td>The wine hour is always worth a visit even ten after a longs day sightseeing and shopping...FB</td></tr><tr><td>A big thank you to Neville who sent Champagne, cupcakes and chocolates up as a special treat - what a lovely touch.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Lots of nice restaurants and delhi's close by.FB</td></tr><tr><td>WIne hour was marvellous!FB</td></tr><tr><td>We were really impressed and the bar and atmosphere was delightful.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Recommend Tony's restaurant off Times Square if you're looking for a brilliant meal at reasonable prices.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Don't think we even ate half!!FB</td></tr><tr><td>They had the best complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning and the best hot apple cider in the evening.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We hung out in the lobby and the library sipping our apple cider in the evening.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Unfortunately, we did not eat in the hotel restaurant but a lady in the elevator told me that it was great.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Within a 5 block radius there are plenty of restaurants and Irish Pubs (which happen to be my favourite!FB</td></tr><tr><td>), so the hotel ammendities were not that important to me on this trip.FB</td></tr><tr><td>There is a good, reasonably priced, family style restaurant at the end of the block called \"the red flame\".FB</td></tr><tr><td>Great breakfast diner restaurant for it's price.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We received a free breakfast with our reservation.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The orange juice was fresh squeezed and delicious.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The basket of pastries were fresh and the fruit was freshly cut.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Our waiter was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The room includes a buffet breakfast.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The suite includes also small kitchenette.FB</td></tr><tr><td>According to the information provided to us at the time of reservation, the refrigerator shall be \"stuffed with selection of non-alcoholic beverages\".FB</td></tr><tr><td>And the reality two non sparkling bottles of water.FB</td></tr><tr><td>If I wanted to have some coke it was necessary to use room service.FB</td></tr><tr><td>They had a nice buffet breakfast included.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The wine hour was a nice touch...can't wait to stay there again!FB</td></tr><tr><td>Interior of The Lambs Club restaurant is also really lovely.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Cool bar.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Free shoe shine and you have a butler who can handle things like pressing your suit or dress for dinner.FB</td></tr><tr><td>There was a kitchenette incluing a mini dishwasher.FB</td></tr><tr><td>All non-alcoholic drinks were included in the room rate.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Since my husband is Hyatt diamond, breakfast for all four adults was included in the rate and we were able to have it delivered to our suite through room service.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The breakfast came from the restaurant downstairs - the shop and everything was delicious.FB</td></tr><tr><td>It was nice to have a refrigerator to store cold drinks, leftovers and breakfast items.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Kitchenette is a godsend and whilst small has everything you need.FB</td></tr><tr><td>wine glasses etc.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Our room had a coffee machine, which was re-stocked with coffee pods and creamer every day by the cleaning staff.FB</td></tr><tr><td>There is also a great restaurant next door, the owner was very nice and makes an effort to greet his customers (and remembers the ones who go back multiple times like us!).FB</td></tr><tr><td>Appreciated the free bottled water.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast is pretty basic and served with plastic plates and cutlery however it did the job.FB</td></tr><tr><td>They have “happy hour” in the afternoons where you get 2 free drinks and nibbles.FB</td></tr><tr><td>I was mortified though when my red wine was served cold!FB</td></tr><tr><td>I've only eaten at the restaurant during breakfast when they have the buffet.FB</td></tr><tr><td>During breakfast during my last visit, the waitress came by one time to bring coffee and I never saw her again until I had to track her down to bring the check.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is decent with pleasent rooms and the kitchenette is very helpful for those of us who are here for a long period of time.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Godiva chocolates were placed on our pillow at night, which you do not see often nowadays.FB</td></tr><tr><td>There is no casual area to have a coffee or snack, just a small lobby with a couple of chairs so if you are staying here for any length of time, you are stuck in your room.FB</td></tr><tr><td>There was a box of Godiva chocolates and flowers welcoming us.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We had been eating in a lot of restaurants and decided to stay in one night.FB</td></tr><tr><td>I said to my husband all I feel like is a toasted cheese sandwich.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We get our order – two plates with covers.FB</td></tr><tr><td>First thing we notice, only one glass of water, we laugh.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Then we lift the lid and were shocked.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The toasted sandwich was that, a cheese toasted sandwich.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Not what you expect from a five star kitchen: there was no parsley for decoration, no fries, no salad just plain crappy white bread with plastic cheese and the crusts cut off and it was very dry (took a photo of it).FB</td></tr><tr><td>Yes but guess what we paid when I asked my husband what the amount was on the bill - $41.00 for two toasted sandwiches and one glass of water.FB</td></tr><tr><td>I would not have minded if we got some fries and salad with that.FB</td></tr><tr><td>In all my travels and I have been travelling most of my life that would go down as the worst hotel dish I have seen and the biggest RIP OFF!FB</td></tr><tr><td>By the way, based on this dish we did not even want to waste our time and money going to the restaurant.FB</td></tr><tr><td>My tip if you are staying at the Sherry, go around corner to the deli we got beautiful sushi (spicy crab) for $5.75.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Oh and I checked what they charged for a toasted cheese sandwich - $12 but you got ham with that and tomato soup plus a bread basket and two glasses of water.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast is fine - pleasantly surprised by the Stoneyfield Farms yogurt...nice perk Ess-A-Bagel is around the corner if you want a true NY bagel.FB</td></tr><tr><td>3. small but important things that better anybody's stay, such as breakfast, free

district.FB</td></tr><tr><td>If you are a Kimpton In Touch member you receive free wifi for your stay and also a $15 gift card to use in the mini-bar.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The wine hour is a nice bonus, however, we only went once.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel also offers complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby area in the morning - personally, we would have preferred a coffee machine/tea station in our room.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We had Thanksgiving dinner at the hotel, and that was a very good experience, even special.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Every night, I was presented with a complimentary evening snack.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Although this wasn't in my package, I was given complimentary breakfast vouchers, and I made use of the shoe shine service which also was a nice amenity.FB</td></tr><tr><td>You are walking distance from many great restaurants and attractions, and a couple train stations (including Grand Central,) so you can get nearly anywhere by subway or train.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Juices, water, delicious teas, and nutritious snacks!FB</td></tr><tr><td>I think there may have been a beer or two, but I did not notice.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast?FB</td></tr><tr><td>Yum!FB</td></tr><tr><td>As a diamond member I got a huge made-to-order breakfast that was about as good as I have ever had.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Oh, and I called for breakfast \"before hours\" to have it delivered when \"breakfast began,\" and there was a gentle knock on my door at the appointed time.FB</td></tr><tr><td>I think the person bringing the food arrived a couple minutes early and waited for the precise second to knock.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Beacon Liquors next store for that nice bottle of wine.Seems to have many international guests.You can pay a lot more money in NYC but you won't do better.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The kitchenette was nice with a full fridge.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Only complaint is that there was no bottled water to buy or have as a guest amenity.FB</td></tr><tr><td>- Daily food/cocktail hour from 5-7pm with delicious sandwiches and soft drinks/beers.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Useful for hungry kidsFB</td></tr><tr><td>- Free breakfast is a decent sized buffetFB</td></tr><tr><td>There are plenty of bars and restaurants within a mile (and even more in Downtown).FB</td></tr><tr><td>The breakfast buffet is nothing special, but is a nice touch.FB</td></tr><tr><td>They have a pretty good breakfast menu and a breakfast buffet that is around $20.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We went out to eat and brought back leftovers and they provided us with a fridge and microwave.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Attended a conference here and the food was served nicely and was good for conference food!FB</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast is good, with a good selection of items, including cooked to order eggs.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Many folks had heaped plates of food which is a good indicator.FB</td></tr><tr><td>I felt that it was a bit too much self service, during the day could not get anything to eat (apart from the horrible microwave food available from the tiny shop (there was a microwave in my room - weird!).FB</td></tr><tr><td>No mini bar in my room, so waking up thirsty with nothing to drink not nice (too many margaritas meant early morning trip to the hotel shop in my jammies).FB</td></tr><tr><td>Bar was also closed during the day so I could not purchase a bottle of wine to take when visiting friends..... pool area ok.... really just a sectioned off part of the car park, so as long as your not shy in your bikini its fine ;-)FB</td></tr><tr><td>I was there on business and it was very handy for a lot of the large oil and gas companies.FB</td></tr><tr><td>They also have better than average breakfast menu but I believe without my company rate (breakfast included), the breakfast would be around $10.FB</td></tr><tr><td>I guess this Extended Stay was recently upgraded to a Deluxe, but it is still just an extended stay property but with bagels and muffins.FB</td></tr><tr><td>High level, sophisticated place, with an excellent restaurant and seamless service.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We dined at the restaurant in the hotel, they messed up our order a couple of times.FB</td></tr><tr><td>And, the bar/restaurant in the

handful of restaurants around the hotel.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Hoping to take advantage of the breakfast buffet (scheduled to open at 6:30 am), we came down at 6:20 am: But, the buffet wasn't even opened until 6:40.FB</td></tr><tr><td>So much for breakfast.FB</td></tr><tr><td>It does have a sweet spot next to a dinner movie theatre and shops.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Alex's Bistro inside the hotel was top notch (and top price) and everything was excellent except for the turtle soup which smelled,tasted, and looked unappetizing.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Continental breakfast is catered from the La Madeleine and excellent.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Lots of fruit choices, cereal, and pastries are available.FB</td></tr><tr><td>They serve lattes and cappuccinos as well.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The only complaints are that we requested breakfast by hanging the tag on the door, and it was never retrieved, and several of the staff speak very broken English and had a hard time understanding our requests.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast in the morning was promptly served and good.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The continental breakfast was perfect for us, convenient with a nice selection of food items and drinks.FB</td></tr><tr><td>In the meantime, I asked her to find the address of a pizzeria in Brooklyn and she printed the pizzeria's info and brought it to me.FB</td></tr><tr><td>They have free parking (though paid parking is only $2 a day around the hotel), a shuttle to downton during the week, and free snacks, wine and beer Monday through Thursday afternoons.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast

always enjoy.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The buffet is a quality buffet with cook to order items and a selection of hot and cold items.FB</td></tr><tr><td>It is a bit pricey, but worth it.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Please note that the \"spencer's steakhouse\" restaurant has closed.FB</td></tr><tr><td>It will be replaced by a mexican place of some sort although it didn't appear that would be the case anytime soon.FB</td></tr><tr><td>My job requires it, so between the free wifi and the snacks/continental breakfast in the EL, the slight increase in the room rate is worth it to me.FB</td></tr><tr><td>nan</td></tr><tr><td>Room - nice enough and clean enough, bed very good as always, toiletries again replaced hap-hazardly and noisy window ACFB</td></tr><tr><td>nan</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast - greasy cooked sausage and bacon, had an omelette which was old and rubbery and some white bread toast which was dry, missed the next couple of mornings even though free with my room rate as really didn't fancy itFB</td></tr><tr><td>Dinner - ate there one night as couldn't be bothered going elsewhere, cobb salad was excellent, burger was not very good, probably a frozen one with plastic cheese - would eat a salad here again.FB</td></tr><tr><td>There are plenty of restaurants and stores in the area and the location is right off the I-10 Freeway.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps the nicest surprise is a small private dining room hidden behind the wine rack in the restaurant, which can only be accessed by walking through the kitchen.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Since the food and food service are both good, it makes a quirkily cozy addition to a meal.FB</td></tr><tr><td>As a Marriott Rewards elite member, I was given a free breakfast at the hotel restaurant (because there is no executive lounge) - which was very tasty.FB</td></tr><tr><td>We had both breakfast buffet and dinner at the hotel restaurant.FB</td></tr><tr><td>While we found the dinner entree menu to be slightly limited, the food was well prepared.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast in the morning was one of the best

check in?FB</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel is surrounded by delightful shops, restaurants and bars.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Fabulous hotel bar.FB</td></tr><tr><td>I had dinner in the restaurant and service and food were flawless.FB</td></tr><tr><td>After checking in, we were tired and hungry, so we found the restaurant downstairs which was still open.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Our food was very good, so good that we decided to go back the next morning for the breakfast buffet.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The buffet was exceptional as well, with a large variety of options.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent quality

environmentally friendly focus of the hotel.FB</td></tr><tr><td>They should allow people to get food from outside.FB</td></tr><tr><td>As the this hotel's food doesn't seem to be very healthy.Very limited options in western breakfast and it was same everyday.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Food is excessively expensiveFB</td></tr><tr><td>foop taste quality and quantity was very

all the guests had breakfast.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The cutlery was not clean.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The restaurant was of the size of the room in which we stayed with just one long table with a seating capacity of 10-12 ppl, and one small square table in center of three sofas.FB</td></tr><tr><td>There was a lot of noise in the breakfast area and above that they played loud bollywood numbers in the restaurant.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The food was again not at all tasty.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is really very easy to locate it being near 32 milestone a prominent place on highway.The stay is just

old and yellow.FB</td></tr><tr><td>No Complimentary breakfast was offeredFB</td></tr><tr><td>Restaurant staff is very good.FB</td></tr><tr><td>I did not like that there was a restaurant on the first floor and you could smell all sorts of different smells whilst walking out of your room to the lift.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Should not  keep any water bottle on dining tableFB</td></tr><tr><td>Approach to the breakfast area was a bit confusing and long winded.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Room service menu is very costly.FB</td></tr><tr><td>A plate of chicken tikka is 1000 rupees.Room dine in is expensive.FB</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel has a very strict policy against outside food and the hotel food is the most expensive I have ever seen.FB</td></tr><tr><td>145 rupees for a small chapati

tea and coffee were not hot enough.FB</td></tr><tr><td> ambience and the staffFB</td></tr><tr><td>Good Cost very high and not given free drink pass.Area, food specially breakfast.FB</td></tr><tr><td>Room was quite with no noise evident from the hallway or adjoining rooms.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It was great to be able to open windows when we craved fresh rather than heated air.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The beds, including the fold out sofa bed, were comfortable and the rooms were cleaned well.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are lovely - beds so comfortable, a great little kitchen and new wizz bang coffee maker.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It was nicely appointed room, but the best part about it was the bathroom.HK</td></tr><tr><td>From the foot soaking bowl to the bath products, everything about the bathroom was awesome!HK</td></tr><tr><td>We had a one bedroom suite that accommodated four people reasonably well.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Plenty of closet space, well lit with floor to ceiling windows, and actually quiet!HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathroom was large with a very nice walk-in shower and a built-in bench with unique low spout to wash your feet.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Perfectly maintained, very comfortable, great bathrooms (best in NYC???).HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathroom is huge, with large shower 'room' and multiple shower heads.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Double lavatories flank one wall.HK</td></tr><tr><td>THe bed is always perfect.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Televisions in both rooms were perfect for my limited time spend in the suite.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Nice desk for work area and in room dining.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Suite has full size refrigerator with icemaker, and also features a microwave, sink and dishwasher drawer....all nicely concealed behind beautiful cabinetry.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Loved the spacious rooms, modern furnishings and all the free offerings (mini bar, cookies, Internet, pressing).HK</td></tr><tr><td>We fell in love with the decor.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Beds were extremely comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Books in the room were a nice touch.HK</td></tr><tr><td>We had two bathrooms after our upgrade which we appreciated a lot.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathrooms were really very chic and the TOTO toilets were something!HK</td></tr><tr><td>The housekeeping service was really good with turn-down service.HK</td></tr><tr><td>We never saw our butler during our 9 night stay, therefore I cannot comment on the butler service, but we did not really need it anyway.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Bathrooms are ideal with Japanese heated cleansing toilettes.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room itself was a decent size, tidy bathroom with powerful shower and Molton Brown products.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The guest rooms are quite large, though the bath is smaller, but we would recommend to friends and stay again on our next NYC visit.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The service, location, cleanliness were outstanding.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Even though the hot water was supposed to be off from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. (do not know if it was or not) it did not affect me.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Having the laundry on the 7th floor was extremely handy.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Lovely bathrooms (although they need a hand towel holder), but really comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>We are a family of 3 so the kiddo slept on the pull-out sofa.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Room was in good condition-- it appears that shade of green must be the theme, but its nice.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Television in both rooms.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It's tough to find good hotels with two beds in a room in NYC so this was a bonus.HK</td></tr><tr><td>One is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Also there is no drawer space and the closet is minuscule.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The other problem is that the beds, at least the twins we slept in, were not very comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms and bathroom were modern and beautiful...we had a suite with a little kitchen mini-bar set up with complimentary espresso-maker, juices etc.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I loved this hotel and couldn’t believe how much money and effort went into the rooms: great bath, built-in cabinetry, automated lighting and drapes, and lots more.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Features that are becoming standard in high end luxury hotels are all there including the in mirror TV and heated bathroom seats made for a nice touch.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Service aside our room had very large windows, a rain shower, and was in full view of the Empire State Building.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Good environmental controls (we like a cool room), large shower (no tub), and a firm bed.HK</td></tr><tr><td>When I asked about the window heating/AC unit, he proceeded to fiddle with it.HK</td></tr><tr><td>There is no lighting in the closet or for that whole end of the room where I was attempting to unpack.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I took the minimum out of my bag for fear of losing the other things in the dark.HK</td></tr><tr><td>All wall plugs are completely filled with the hotel's stuff.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I had to get down on my hands and knees to find a strip plug underneath the desk for my IPad to charge.HK</td></tr><tr><td>However, to my dismay the next morning I found that when I turned off the desk light, the desk plug also went dead and my phone did NOT charge overnight.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The mattress was good and that is why this hotel received three stars instead of two.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Now, the shower: I scalded my right arm turning off the shower because there are absolutely NO markings on the shower as where hot, cold or off is.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I recommend that you step outside the tub/shower before turning it off and be sure not to have any part of you under the water when turning it off.HK</td></tr><tr><td>There is no ventilation in the bathroom.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Therefore, not only was the bathroom completely steamed, which ruined my hair, but also the bedroom windows.HK</td></tr><tr><td>In addition, there are dark brown wooden shutters that cannot be lifted, only tilted that further curtail light entering this room.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Sleeping: Although the mattress was comfortable, I had to wear earplugs and play a sound soother to sleep well.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It was very clean and orderly.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The beds were very comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>10 minutes later, I was able to finally find out a room wasn't ready.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Otherwise, the bed and pillows were very comfortable and I was impressed that the room had a small refrigerator (in addition to the mini bar), microwave, and a drawer that contained plates and silverware.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The beds and pillows were fantastic along with the small bathtub to rest your feet.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was again really nice, clean, though unfortunately not the \"suite size I had experienced last times(was realy an upgrade at that time).HK</td></tr><tr><td>It had a small sitting room, with all what you needed in your room, refrigerator, coffee, trousers iron,....Excellent location in mid Manhattan, good breakfast for NY standards(all included).HK</td></tr><tr><td>As to it being a “cherished boutique hotel” or a “luxury hotel”, so described on the Sherry-Netherland website, it was shabby and the décor in my room had nothing in particular to recommend it.HK</td></tr><tr><td>with a plush white robe and ample space to hang things, a Keurig coffee maker with unlimited coffee pods, a chandelier, fresh bouquets of flowers, boxes of Godiva chocolates, and a \"welcome\" card from the hotel manager.HK</td></tr><tr><td>They would tidy up the newspapers and clothes in my room, and make sure it looked warm and cozy for when I got home.HK</td></tr><tr><td>We used the laundrette in the hotel and it was clean and well lit - what more could you want.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms were modern, spacious and clean and the beds were heaven after a long day walking around manhattan.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms were excellent and attached which fitted our family needs very well.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Only one drawer in the room so I used the office to lay out my suitcase and lived out of the that.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Bathroom was roomy and the bed very comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Decor is Japanese sensibility meets European minimalism.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The controls for the shower were very challenging--no kidding!HK</td></tr><tr><td>Lastly, an observation and not a complaint: no holiday decorations to be found here in the midst of December!HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are really modern (minimalist type decor) and very clean, stylish and spacious bathroom, mini bar included except for the liquor.HK</td></tr><tr><td>My only issue was the lack of wardrobe or closet.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is a great location, it has spacious rooms and very comfortable beds!!HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was quite small, but the bathroom was well appointed and the shower was great.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I'd stay here again on business, but wouldn't take my husband as he likes to have a bath as well as a shower.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathrooms are fabulous with tv's fitted into the mirrors, heated toilet seats and jucuzzi baths.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rain shower is one of the best I ever had.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The beds are very comfortable and the Art Deco style furniture has been well thought out and is of exceptional quality.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was not super big (but I guess this is NYC).HK</td></tr><tr><td>Ours had 2 queen beds and not much room for anything else.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The one negative was that it was rather dimly lit even when we turned on every last light, but from what I understand this is a green hotel and they are saving on energy and wattage.HK</td></tr><tr><td>However, we would have liked to have the room a bit brighter since there was also a lot of woodwork and dark closet doors which also made the room on the dark side even during the day.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The beds were extremely comfortable with nice white fluffy duvet comforters and down pillows.HK</td></tr><tr><td>There were a lot of outlets and close to the bed (and located on the nightstands) which were great for charging phones and computers.HK</td></tr><tr><td>A couple of blocks from the subway and stones throw from a shopping haven :)HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was big with lots of space, all the things you need in the room, TV, iPod dock and a really comfy bed!HK</td></tr><tr><td>I would of taken this home if i could of fitted it in my case :)HK</td></tr><tr><td>Lots of power sockets for charging phones etc.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Oh, and the comfiest bed I have ever ever slept in!!!HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was clean and cozy.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It had a TV, dresser draws, a little fridge, a good sized bathtub shower and a desk with chair.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It was one of the cleanest rooms we have ever stayed at.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathroom was updated and wonderful.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are exceptionally clean with great amenities.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Very easy access, convenient location, clean and confortable rooms.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It features a pullout sofa in a sitting area as well as a small kitchen.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The linens and appointments are top notch.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are spotless and comfy.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Effectively, the attention of the hotel is good, the rooms are clear and clean.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Beautiful decor and the rooms are well furbished with antiques and chandeliers.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Apartment living in the best locale in town....lounge, dining, kitchen and bedroom with plenty of closet space and a glorious bathroom.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The king room in which we started was also a reasonable size....nice decor with small bathroom...still value for money considering the location ...which is the most outstanding feature and benefit.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The suite was really very spacious and comfrotable with huge spa bathroom.HK</td></tr><tr><td>NO BATHTUB!HK</td></tr><tr><td>Leather closet doors that looked like trunks, an excellent bar area, and a comfortable big bed.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathroom is amazing.HK</td></tr><tr><td>While there was no bathtub, the shower made up for it as it was very large, and the toilet was quite neat with all these japanese style options.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The amenities provided were also excellent.HK</td></tr><tr><td>We also used the butler service to have our shoes shined, and clothes pressed before dinner.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel itself is very clean and modern in terms of the reception area and the rooms.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The décor made the room feel very special and the bed was extremely comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Big, nice and clean rooms and suites.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was clean, bright and more than ample.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are very spacious and spotless.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The suite was great for 4 ladies.HK</td></tr><tr><td>They also provided us extra pillows and towels when we requested them and band-aids for my friend who got blisters from walking all day.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room is so comfortable from the bed to the little details.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Love every detail, the lights, the outlets for phones and computers that are strategically placed and suprisingly we didn't hear the NY noise like many other hotels.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Sometimes it is the little things, I loved the plugs in the night stands for my phone!!HK</td></tr><tr><td>Very clean, nice television, very comfy beds with tons of pillows.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are done up kind of like I'd imagine a 1920s cruise ship.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Leather doors with leather handles, kind of like old time steamer trunks.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Lots of cubbies and efficient use of space.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Bathrooms are awesome.HK</td></tr><tr><td>As others have mentioned, the toilets have an unreal number of functions--bidet, seat warmer, air dry.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Wish the bed had been a bit more comfy and higher off the floor--all the beds seemed very, very low--but overall I was pretty happy with the space.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The same with the bathroom.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rain shower is the best I have experienced, and my wife just loved the Toto toilet, which shall we say possesses many added extra's to make your bathroom experience more entertaining!HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathrooms are huge and clean and the beds are extremely comfortable!HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathrooms are sleek with C.O.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Bigelow toiletries.HK</td></tr><tr><td>This hotel features beautiful bathrooms and stylish, trendy decor.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The furnishings (chairs and desk) are at a level about 4 inches below normal.HK</td></tr><tr><td>There is no comfortable chair or sofa on which to sit; when in your room, only the bed offers any true respite.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Televisions are wall mounted flat screens, but set only about four feet off the ground, so unless you are in bed, an adult generally would look down to the screen.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Finally, in the beautiful bath, black mold was evident in the tile grout and was also on the shower wall, although not obvious since it was obscured by the coloration of the tile.HK</td></tr><tr><td>(There is a fold out couch in the living room).HK</td></tr><tr><td>Room was cleaned daily and you can ask for extra kitchen things, like sharp knife (!!)HK</td></tr><tr><td>(I don't know if this was an issue with our room only) - The bathroom didn't have any sort of ventilation, so we had to shower with the door open or the whole room would steam up.HK</td></tr><tr><td>We loved the bed linens and the soaps and other toiletries which were of high quality.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Spacious, well furnished room including microwave.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Guest self-service laundry facilities provided - $1 per load to wash and an extra $1 per load to dry.HK</td></tr><tr><td>There is only one washing machine and one dryer however.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was very clean, fresh, new, stylish, and very quiet.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bed was very comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The towels were fluffy, fresh, and large.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are clean with flat screen TV's and the beds are comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Lovely room, bathroom full of free amenities, free softdrinks in your room, ...HK</td></tr><tr><td>Other positives were; spacious bedroom, heaps of wardrobe space, free wifi, free sodas that were refilled every day, comfy bed, plenty of bathroom amenities, choice of newspaper, heaps of TV channels and a coffee machine.HK</td></tr><tr><td>There were a lot of old world touches.HK</td></tr><tr><td>So between 8.00 – 8.30am you would hear the ripping of masking tape and while doing this the person laying the board would have a very loud conversation with the housekeeping staff or other tradesmen, right near our room.HK</td></tr><tr><td>So rather than wake up naturally, without fail we were woken by the staff of the “hotel”.HK</td></tr><tr><td>There were mornings on the weekend when I woke up to the housekeeping staff calling out to bring more towels or for a staff member calling for security on her walkie talkie.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathroom – it was small.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Then I looked at the bottom of it, the non-slip surface was fifty shades of grey, there was no way I was sitting on that.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It needed to be replaced or given a damn good bleach.HK</td></tr><tr><td>This leads me into housekeeping, extremely inconsistent.HK</td></tr><tr><td>If a hotel is renovating and it expects its guests to stay within the area during this phase then the housekeeping needs to be vigilant with keeping building dust to a minimum.HK</td></tr><tr><td>After about four days I noticed the build up of dust.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It is important to note here that there was a lot of drawers and wardrobe space so we did not leave a lot of personal items out on the side cabinets or tables.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The housekeeping did not have to move any personal items to dust.HK</td></tr><tr><td>By day five I was able to write words into the dust, I wrote “hello” on the TV stand and it still did not get cleaned.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I am not sure if the bathroom got cleaned, as there was a pubic hair on the daddo by the toilet and stayed there for the full two weeks with all the dust.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Also for the international visitors who may not know, you can take your washing to a dry cleaner and they do it for you, usually one pound of clothing costs about $1.00.HK</td></tr><tr><td>We had 44 items of clothing washed and it cost $20.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It had a large sitting room, with a refrigerator, and wet bar.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bedroom was comfortable with a nice king size bed with soft, comfortable linens.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Both rooms had flat screen TVs and a wide selection of channels.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathrooms were large by NYC standards.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Nice appointments including nice fluffy towels.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Bathrooms were an unexpected luxury.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I come to NY regularly and always stay at the San Carlos hotel as it has a rare combination of:HK</td></tr><tr><td>1. top rooms that get the highest level of maintenanceHK</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel room was a decent size, very clean and the bed was very comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>However, we did find the lighting in our room a little dark.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The air conditioning was good, especially as it was cold during our stay.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It was also nice that we were able to open the windows for some fresh air if needed.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathroom was well appointed.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathroom is amazing; 4 people could have fit in the shower.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The suite should have had a bathtub, though, for the price paid.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms were very quiet and we slept very well.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Pushbutton curtains, full kitchen/livingroom, beverage stocked fridge, washer/dryer!).HK</td></tr><tr><td>Unlike others, I LOVE the minimalistic decor and found the staff (Gabriel, door/bell & concierge ladies) to be delightfully friendly, accommodating & attentive.HK</td></tr><tr><td>(Did I mention the bed was beyond expectation too?HK</td></tr><tr><td>Like floating in a cloud, even better than my marshmallow bed at home.)HK</td></tr><tr><td>And windows that open!HK</td></tr><tr><td>As some have commented, the decor is decidedly along the lines of a corporate apartment.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Great amenities.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Wonderful shower.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Ipod docking station.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The only quibb is the size of the open wardrobe.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was the very large, modern, clean, sleek, and one of the best bathrooms ever.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The baths had exquisite amenities, the most heavenly showers I have enjoyed, the plushest towels I can recall, and there were luxurious robes every where.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathrooms, and the closets had several.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I did not listen to the stereo nor watch TV/DVDs, but the room was equipped to be entertained in style.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The minibar...ahhhh, finally a minibar the way it would be if I chose what goes in it!HK</td></tr><tr><td>King orthopedic bed, fine linens, and not a sound!HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are very modern and somewhat quirky - all electronic lightings and lots of glass and metal.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Suites are great with two separate rooms, plenty of space, great bed, small kitchen and comfortable living room.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Very well maintained and clean.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Bathroom off the bedroom and well appointed.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Staff is very attentive, especially the ladies who clean the rooms.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel suite was two separate rooms and was decorated in a lovely way.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Room was clean and spacious, staff was personable and professional, and the location even better than I hoped.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The beds were comfy.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Great shower.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel is clean, room was clean.HK</td></tr><tr><td>This hotel was clean, modern, friendly (reception staff excellent) and ticked most boxes, room size average, bathroom basic but had everything i needed (although bath very slippy and a colleauge of mine who also stayed slipped and fell badly in the shower).HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bed is comfortable with adjustable dial to suit your preference.HK</td></tr><tr><td>And thanks to the entire staff that made sure my room was definitely spotless weekly; It certainly was a home away from home.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms are nice and large with a kitchenette separate from the living area and the bed in its own area.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture in good condition except for the bed's mattress, its time to change out the bedding when there is a well worn dip in the middle.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Cleaning staff does amazing jobs in the rooms and the front desk staff know me by name and have always been a pleasure to talk too.HK</td></tr><tr><td>A+ Facility all the way!HK</td></tr><tr><td>Housekeeping was late, and inconsistent ( forgot to service the coffee pot on two days, for example.)HK</td></tr><tr><td>Took 35 minutes to get ice delivered.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Although the room was clean and the view was nice overlooking the city, this hotel left a lot to be desired.HK</td></tr><tr><td>By design this is a very poor choice by the hotel as hospitality suites are typically for parties.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Absent that,the hotel appeared to be clean and nice.HK</td></tr><tr><td>There on a business conference and the catering was excellent and the conference staff very accommodating.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bed was amazingly comfortable, which is always a plus.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are immaculate.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Room was very nice, light, with good bed and no noise.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Location, genteel ambience, comfort, staffing of all services, quality of dining, room quality and cleanliness are exceptional.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Location, attention to detail, size of room, cleanliness, staff professionalism, Harry's Bar.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is good, centrally located, well maintained and very clean.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Bedrooms is classicly decorated, with good bed, well kept toilet... there is free water and soda inside rooms.HK</td></tr><tr><td>We had a suite that included two rooms, two queen beds and a sofa sleeper, and a kitchenette.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It was also clean.HK</td></tr><tr><td>It was a one bedroom suite with 2 Queen beds + 1 sofa bed.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Perfect for a family of 4 with 2 children who didn't want to sleep in the same bed!HK</td></tr><tr><td>Their largest room has only two queen beds and they have no roll aways, so our family of six needed two rooms (which gets expensive).HK</td></tr><tr><td>Our room was large and very clean, the bed was comfortable, and of course it comes with the usual complimentary breakfast (which was excellent) and parking.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was spacious and convenient.HK</td></tr><tr><td>We especially appreciated a very good AC in our room, fresh cookies, a fridge and microwave in our room, outdoor pool, and a very clean room.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Housekeeping who works very hard to keep us all happy and to maintenance who keeps the hotel running smooth and looking good.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was very tidy and clean.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The whole hotel was clean smelling and quiet.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms are ultra clean, the service is very very good & personable and the food & drink are excellent.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The meeting rooms are quite well designed, and, best of all, everything works - including AV and conference lines, which in most places are disasters waiting to happen.HK</td></tr><tr><td>A living room with large TV to watch 99 TV stations and lots of great movies whilst you get over your Jet Lag!HK</td></tr><tr><td>The service in a 5 star hotel like the Four Seasons is just Fantastic.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was clean and quite large.HK</td></tr><tr><td>With great amenities and style.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Comfortable bed and very quiet.HK</td></tr><tr><td>However, at 4am I was awoken to the sound of running water in the bathroom.HK</td></tr><tr><td>This was very alarming.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I found water pouring in from a light socket above the toilet.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I don't see how leaving the shower door open would have caused this - probably a tub or sink (or worse - toilet) overflowed.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was clean, and our stay was great.HK</td></tr><tr><td>i really like the deluxe room with kingsize bed and jacuzzi.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Other than that small inconvenience, bed clean, very comfortable and couldn't ask for anything else.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Our room was spotless as well as the bathroom which was roomy and had great shower and large tub.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel was great, very cool decorations and set up!HK</td></tr><tr><td>Otherwise, the room was clean, comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>I loved the ambiance of the place.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms are spacious and housekeeping even folded my dirty clothes and placed a folded laundry bag on top for easy access.HK</td></tr><tr><td>My husband needed help with tying his tie and the wonderful staff at the front desk were happy to help.HK</td></tr><tr><td>They always remember that I need a feather-free room.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Amenities are nice and changed seasonally.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms are small but comfortable and impeccably maintained.HK</td></tr><tr><td>While our room was small, it was well appointed, comfortable and quiet.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Comfortable rooms, friendly staff.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are always clean and comfortable and are of generous size for New York.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Room, bed and sound proofing was great.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Hospitality and courtesy extended by staff was great.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The house keeping and poor maintenance of Hotel and very old appliances in the room.Poor room service.Very less

Service goodHK</td></tr><tr><td>Bed linen had strange pungent smell similar to wet linen type. Location is the only advantage with this hotel.HK</td></tr><tr><td>the air conditioning was not very good, one edge of the bed was cold and the other end was hot.The room was big enough and comfortable for our family having two small kids, location was the best part, which is very close to the airport.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Dreadful air conditioning - humidity and mildew problems everywhere - awful smell of mildew as soon as you enter the lobby and the rooms are so damp the bed linen is moist.Convenient location for a short stay in MumbaiHK</td></tr><tr><td>During the monsoon season the lack of ventilation made the room smell and the linen damp.Customer Service was excellent.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Bed comfyHK</td></tr><tr><td>the mattress was a little tough.Luxury property, nice service and kind employees.HK</td></tr><tr><td>My room was pre-paid and I was asked to pay for all room service which was embarrassing and inconvenience to say the least.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Very poor coordination.Food - very goodHK</td></tr><tr><td>linens we full of moistureHK</td></tr><tr><td>The mattress as it was very soft, and i suffer from a lower back problem, so it does not help me.The breakfast spread was good, the room as was in the new wing was better and with modern amenities.Front desk was very efficient and helpful.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Breakfast was also not completely upto the mark.Bed and pillows were quite comfortable.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The room was stuffy and damp.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The AC wasn't working efficiently.The location was excellent.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The bathroom could have been cleaner.The view of the airport from the roomHK</td></tr><tr><td>Could be a bit more cleaner.Really old furniture.Breakfast Resonably pricedHK</td></tr><tr><td>Some of th furniture needs some update ...Location , mezzanine ResturantHK</td></tr><tr><td>The room and the corridors had a peculiar smell which did not go ever.HK</td></tr><tr><td>So that was disappointing.The room was spacious with good basic amenitiesHK</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms need rebuilding and ax need updating lots of humidity in the roomsHK</td></tr><tr><td>The air was very humid in the room because of the central climate system and the bedclothes were humid because of this.HK</td></tr><tr><td>The drainage in the shower area was blocked, access to the room was cumbersome from the lobbyHK</td></tr><tr><td>Bathroom sink not flushing, no iron box in the room. CleanlinessHK</td></tr><tr><td>House keeping can be a bit more throughThe duty manager Amit was kind and Helpfulan asset to the teamHK</td></tr><tr><td>I like a firm bed but this was extra hard - uncomfortable night. Beautiful Hotel - great roof top restaurantHK</td></tr><tr><td>Cleanliness could be better especially the buttons in the lift which look corroded and even numbers are not visible.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Also the phone set in the room is very dirty and accumulated lots of dust and dirt so we can't even keep it on our ear.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Cleanliness could be better especially the buttons in the lift which look corroded and even numbers are not visible.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Also the phone set in the room is very dirty and accumulated lots of dust and dirt so we can't even keep it on our ear.HK</td></tr><tr><td>Wi-fi access worked like a dream with only one connectivity issue on our first night and this was promptly responded to with a call from the service provider to ensure that all was well.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room has a sleek modern design and was spacious for NYC standards.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our room was on the 20th floor overlooking Broadway and the madhouse of the Fairway Market.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We called downstairs and within 3 minutes, we had four.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Overall, no complaints, would definitely return again.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We two different rooms different rooms during our stay.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The first room was in the North tower, which was quite inconvenient.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The second room was the Andaz Suite.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The Andaz is a nice hotel in a central location of Manhattan.FO</td></tr><tr><td>When you arrive you are greeted by friendly \"Hosts\" and they walk you to the check-in desk while offering you a beverage.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My room (suite) on the 12th floor was fantastic as usual.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I do have 2 complaints.FO</td></tr><tr><td>the location is good , and the staff was courteous .FO</td></tr><tr><td>THE ACESS TO THE HOTEL IS VERY CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT TO REACH THE HOTELFO</td></tr><tr><td>Of course, i really don't know...as there is no bill.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They just deliver it, and leave.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The Lobby Lounge has some seating and one table with 8 or so chairs where you can buy food from the adjacent restaurant.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Prices are listed in the in-suite menu, but no itemized billing is given.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I am 'gifted' with a $75.00 credit for my breakfast as a Diamond member, and i assumed that had not been applied when my bill reflected a 'non itemized' charge for $110 plus for the first night, and slightly less for the second.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I was wrong, it had been applied (no way for me to see this).FO</td></tr><tr><td>It certainly isn't worth it.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I know i sound like one of those guys who complains about pricing, but clearly doesn't know what things cost.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent staff (they remembered our names from the moment our family walked in).FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our original suite was overbooked, so we ended up in a much nicer suite (no complaints here).FO</td></tr><tr><td>Extremely convenient location to Fifth Avenue shopping, restaurants, and subway system.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Use the concierge, they worked magic throughout our entire stay.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Regardless of whether we needed tickets, or merely a ride, the staff would go out of their way to make sure we were happy.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Although the hotel is not near Lincoln Center, which is where we shuttled to every day, I found the hotel to be a true gem.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Regina/Chris in sales stayed all night to help coordinate my guests, and Brian/Matt/Louis from the front desk could not have been nicer.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The door men were amazing- they assisted our last-minute transport needs with grace, special thank you to Joe, Mike and the security team.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We arrived at the hotel very late at night but our check-in was very easy and just like many other reviewers we got upgraded to a suite.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The lobby smelled lovely with their signature scent.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My husband had a couple of pre-arranged deliveries and the concierge were very helpful with them.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Wonderful boutique hotel located next to Times Square.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was very nice and always accommodating.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Wonderful staff, beautiful hotel, incredibly comfortable rooms and for my needs terrific location.FO</td></tr><tr><td>It is perfectly located two blocks from Times Square and one block from Fifth Avenue.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Walking to Central Park took approximately 20 minutes, Times Square was less than 5 minutes away and with close Subway stations access to all of Manhattan is a piece of cake.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Location aside, the hotel was very clean and well appointed.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We had a room on the 11th floor, and after sending the hotel an email prior to our arrival they provided a room with a view of the Chrysler Building, as requested.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Both the concierge and the front desk staff were very helpful and courteous, as were the bell boys.FO</td></tr><tr><td>A wonderful little touch was the urn in the reception area.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Great location.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel is a few minutes walk from Rockefeller center and 5th avenue.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The door staff were great, they found us a taxi at rush hour in the rain which in NYC isn't the easiest thing to do.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The only problem we had was that our safe was not working when we arrived, (battery was duff) but this was fixed within 20 mins.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Location was great, rooms large in good condition, well appointed and staff friendly and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>San Carlos was a great location for all the mid and uptown events and attractions we had planned.FO</td></tr><tr><td>An intimate atmosphere, attentive courteous staff, wonderful location across the street from Central Park.FO</td></tr><tr><td>When we pulled up at the curb in front of the hotel we were greeted immediately by the bellman.FO</td></tr><tr><td>He whisked our luggage into the hotel, the car was taken care of and we were instantly relaxing, enjyoing NYC.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Great location - only 2 blocks from 72nd St subway.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We had a 1 bedroom suite on the 24th floor and had a wonderful view of the Hudson River and the upper West Side.FO</td></tr><tr><td>US$1.75 per load and you could get change from the front reception.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff and front doormen were all very friendly and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>For NYC, a nice sized Queen suite gave us everything we needed.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms were comfortable (ok... a little tight at the foot of the bed but not like some complaints described), the amenities were really appreciated, e.g., free wifi, Keurig coffee service in room, desk area, energy efficient rooms (you put your room card in a device that controls the electricity to save energy while you're out).FO</td></tr><tr><td>The bellman held our luggage after checkout to allow us to stay in the city and not have to worry about our bags.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Friendly front desk folks were really helpful -- have breakfast at Bagel Talk not too far away.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We had a room on the 24th floor so great views of San Remo building and Central Park but building sways ALOT in windy weather, very weird at first!FO</td></tr><tr><td>Had a king suite, which really was a suite, with sitting room/kitchenette, bedroom and bath.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room was at the rear of the building, which might have been a problem on lower floors (the air shaft was below us); however, we were on the 10th floor and had a decent view to the east, overlooking rooftops.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was very friendly and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>VERY spacious with a HUGE bathroom!FO</td></tr><tr><td>My only complaint was there was no one to help us with bags or getting a cab.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We had quite a bit of luggage and no one was around to open the door at the entrance (which consists of 2 black doors that are also not marked.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We wandered around a bit before realizing this WAS the main entrance)!!FO</td></tr><tr><td>We needed to get a cab to the train station and were told that none were available and that we should try and walk to Madison Ave to get one!FO</td></tr><tr><td>No easy feat with lots of luggage and it was quite the walk.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Clearly they should have the means to summon a cab.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Went with my adult daughter and we stayed in a corner room with two twin beds on the ninth floor.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The seating in the \"lobby\" is not particularly comfortable or inviting.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They did the best they could to help with restaurant reservations, shopping information and other general information.FO</td></tr><tr><td>There are a few problems that I believe can be corrected easily.FO</td></tr><tr><td>It is very dark and would be really difficult if you were trying to get ready for a special event.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Not only is the 5th Avenue property in a great location, but the rooms are wonderfully designed and well appointed and the staff does a great job in terms of customer service.FO</td></tr><tr><td>However, the young lady checked us in quickly and asked for a phone number to call us when our room was ready.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We went out to have breakfast and before we were finished she call to let me know that the room was ready.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The only drawback is that the Internet is painstakingly slow, which is the reaso for the 4 stars.FO</td></tr><tr><td>It is a boutique-style hotel with a European feel; staff always ready to serve and yet laid-back and friendly.FO</td></tr><tr><td>It was such a great stay and such a beautiful hotel and everyone on staff could not have been nicer!!!FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are surprisingly large for NY and beautifully appointed.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was very hospital and could not do enough to make sure i was comfortable.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I received my normal upgrade as a platinum member and the bell cap enjoyed giving me the tour of the suite room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We were at the 21st floor and had a great view to the ESB (full window from floor to ceiling) and the surroundings.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Easy access to everything (we were mostly walking and took the hopon/hopoff tours for further site).FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was helpful and pleasant.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Price was reasonnable for NYC.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Everyone at the front desk was superb and we were treated like royalty.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We got a reasonable (for NYC) rate ~ $330 with free wi-fi, $15 from mini-bar (which equals about 2 items!).FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms do have plenty of outlets for computers, charging phones, etc., and good video connections to the flat screen TV to allow viewing our own video through iPads, computers for those techies.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Yes the area is not trendy or cute, but if one can get a good rate this is a very attractive hotel.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The Eventi, a boutique hotel at Sixth Avenue and 30th Street, is part of the Kimpton chain and is typically attractive, with a pleasant, helpful staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel is clean, cosy and welcoming with a classic decor, staff are also welcoming and friendly.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Price seemed reasonable for the location but the room was a bit smaller than what we would have liked (couple + 6 yr old) and with three suitcases we had to place one on the floor near the door since there was no where else to put it.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The place was very clean and the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I arrived around 8:30 p.m., calling ahead to tell the hotel when to expect me and found no doorman and no help with luggage to unload or go up the steps with my bags.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Once checked in, an employee decided to show me to the room with me trailing along with my luggage and holding the door to the elevator for him.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I finally told him to take the luggage.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Once in the room I was told that I was not allowed to adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat.FO</td></tr><tr><td>He lied and said it was off.FO</td></tr><tr><td>And this room really needs more light.FO</td></tr><tr><td>When the neighboring room turned on its shower, the water sound screamed and bubbled right at the headboard to my bed.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I checked out in the AM for a conference, stored my luggage at the hotel and was allowed to use the gym in the late PM to change my shoes for my trip home in the early evening.FO</td></tr><tr><td>And finally, when I noted some of the deficiencies to the person who originally escorted me to my room his answer was: \"It is What it is.\"FO</td></tr><tr><td>Now that I am safely at home, I can laugh at this most ridiculous interpretation of customer service I have ever heard.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The friendliest staff ever.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Nice size room - very clean - every night a member of staff brings you chocolates and a weather forecast for the next day.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Allan the concierge is wonderful - very knowledgeable and gives his honest opinion - everwhere he suggested was great.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel staff was so nice and accommodating.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They let us keep our bags there before and after checkout so we weren't burdened with them while walking the streets and doing some sightseeing.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The front desk offered great advice for a restaurant that was only a couple of blocks away from the hotel, and they made the reservation for us.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed in a room with two Queen-sized beds, and I will say that the size of the room in general was very large compared to many other NYC hotels.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My initial impression was not positive.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I stopped by early to see if I could check in before my meeting and the man at the front desk just seemed to want to chat....and chat....and chat.FO</td></tr><tr><td>When I finally checked in at 5:30, I was given a handicapped room which just had some interesting things in the bathroom.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff are lovely and helpful and the rooms kept spotless.FO</td></tr><tr><td>So it starts with a greeted curb side by the doorman who took my suitcase right to the front desk.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The check in at the front desk staff was polite and professional but a little bit \"cold\" .FO</td></tr><tr><td>To begin with, a wide-angle lens was used to photograph the lobby and sitting area, which together are nothing more than a hallway.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Therefore, the derision with which the person on the desk met my query came as a shock.FO</td></tr><tr><td>She informed me that since I’d only booked a room and not a suite, I couldn’t expect anything, She went on to ask if I thought they had microwaves just lying around.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I requested that this rude X-X look into the matter and, 20 minutes later, someone came with the oven.FO</td></tr><tr><td>This was my experience of their much vaunted concierge service.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They were a nice enough bunch and I’m glad they have work, but they are somewhat redundant.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The accommodations were so wonderful - enormous beautiful room overlooking Central Park and close to the subway and great eating and shopping spots.FO</td></tr><tr><td>And the staff was flat out great.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They helped us regain our subway prowess, helped with tickets, and they were very accommodating, friendly, and professional.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The location was great - right across from the Plaza Hotel, the Apple Store, and a stone's throw to the beautiful shops on Fifth Avenue.FO</td></tr><tr><td>When I arrived, I was greeted by a friendly concierge.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My room was everything a girl could want on her first business trip to NYC - a dressing room (!!!)FO</td></tr><tr><td>Within 10 minutes someone was upstairs to check on the situation, and shortly thereafter things quieted down.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Similarly, when I couldn't get the wifi to work, the concierge offered to send up an IT person to help me figure it out.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was attentive, and although they had a bit of that brusque NY attitude (different from what Canadians are typically used to), they were extremely helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms are vary large, especially for a NY hotel, and nicely decorated.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Everyone was welcoming and accommodating and went out of their way to help, from the front desk people to the elevator operators to the room service guy.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The people who work here are so friendly!FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are very large - we were on the tenth floor - and had a kitchenette/lounge and a bedroom and three walk-in wardrobes !!FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the location was great - handy to central park - a short walk down to the Hudson - the 72nd street train station was just a short walk away... and the best feature of the area was the \"Fairway Market\" - everything you could want in the way of food/groceries/drink is at your fingertips..right across the road and the little restaurant upstairs does a great breakfast (and a really good latte !!!)FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff were friendly and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite which was very affordable and perfect for our family of four.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The beacon hotel was a fantastic place to stay with friendly and polite staff who could not do enough for you.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Location is hard to beat.FO</td></tr><tr><td>A word to the wise and select your room carefully here.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We had a loft room on the 8th floor; half of the room is an \"office\" (it really is an office!)FO</td></tr><tr><td>which they did inform us at check in.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room is really only appropriate for a single business traveler.FO</td></tr><tr><td>For the most part the staff was very helpful and friendly and attentive.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Entrances, dining areas, lounges are not well marked so you have to guess your way around for a bit.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I would definitely stay here again but would be more discriminating about the choice of room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was amazing specially Jenny Rodriguez from concierge who helped us a lot before and after our stay.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The best hotel I ever stayed in NYC, the room is very nice, the bed very comfortable, modern and stylish, you can get a good rate if you book well in advanceFO</td></tr><tr><td>Great locationFO</td></tr><tr><td>Very friendly staffFO</td></tr><tr><td>No loyalty programFO</td></tr><tr><td>The room has no viewFO</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel was beautiful and the staff was so friendly and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>After a few great recommendations from the concierge and some great meals and nights out we decided to stay in our last night and were delighted to have amazing food, great live jazz and incredible service.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Very clean, beautiful rooms and a welcoming staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Special thanks to the reservation manager Deryk.FO</td></tr><tr><td>He has been extremely helpful before and throughout our stay.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Amazing and professional service!!FO</td></tr><tr><td>Having checked in during the evening and out again at 7:30am, I can't really comment on the facilities.FO</td></tr><tr><td>However, there was no room service menu in my room, no hotel facilities directory and no breakfast card.FO</td></tr><tr><td>This would have annoyed me if I had been staying longer.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Great Staff!!FO</td></tr><tr><td>From the moment we checked in, we made friends with the staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They were friendly and fun and extra nice to my 12-year old son.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They recognized us each time we walked in and out, which made things really great.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The great thing that we noticed is that the staff really liked each other and seemed to have a lot of fun working there.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We were on a high floor with nice views.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms with two beds don't face the empire state building, which was a bummer because we hoped to see it from the windows.FO</td></tr><tr><td>There we a few hiccups but they got resolved in a timely manner by the hotel staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Staff are really attentive and friendly and want to ensure that your stay if perfect.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We were impressed from the moment we walked in - excellent check in, efficient and friendly staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We went for my 30th birthday and I was given a little present at check in.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We requested a room with a view and they didn't disappoint.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We were given a room on the top floor with brilliant views across the city.FO</td></tr><tr><td>It was nice to sit and talk to other people staying at the hotel.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff were very professional and always had a smile.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our suite, #1000, had the most amazing view of Rockefeller Centre.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Also, the windows open nice and wide, which was good because the hotel has that stuffy old hotel air, which gives it its charm but also makes it hard to sleep at night.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My husband thought the room was a little small but I thought it was just right.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel conceirge was fabulous when it came to giving us directions, especially subway lines, so don't worry about having to navigate it all by yourself.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was friendly and the room was as described.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was wonderfully attentive without being overbearing.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They went the extra mile to make me feel comfortable and give \"idiot proof\" directions to this tourist.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are large for NYC standards.FO</td></tr><tr><td>No luxuries but well kept.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My husband, college-age son and I stayed in the executive suite at the San Carlos hotel for the second time this year.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The executive suite is perfectly designed for 2 or 3 people.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff is the best.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our suite/rooms were amazinginly spacious for NYC, charming, and comfortable.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel was clean, quiet, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We only used the fitness facility once because the weather is perfect for jogs in Central Park instead, but did find it a bit small and outdated compared to other high end hotels.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Great staff, best location and old world charm.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite...absolutely fabulous.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Staff were very helpful ...very friendly ....fabulous service.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed in the City One Bedroom Suite during our short trip to NYC.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Very much enjoyed the incredibly spacious suite, the beautiful views of NYC and great interior design and architecture of both rooms and hotel.FO</td></tr><tr><td>It was not overpriced but still very annoying.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The other negative aspect was that we were not provided with advantages as LHW members except for thenice personal letter from the manager.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Usually we receive at least some fruits, uograde, free internet or something...FO</td></tr><tr><td>The last negative point was about pre arrival assistance and concierge.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We sent some requirements before our arrival but got answer only very late as our email was categorized as spam and the concierge had not chcecked the spam folder.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We also had some difficulties with our reservation when in the city and were not able to reach the concierge via phone.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We succeeded only after 15 minutes and sixth call.FO</td></tr><tr><td>One great tip about the hotel: no checkout time limit.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We stayed an unfortunate four nights at this hotel, and suffered major itching, including a major let down from what we were advised BEFORE booking at The Chatwal!FO</td></tr><tr><td>We phoned prior to booking to ensure that the hotel had bathtubs (as our personal preference, we only book with hotels which have bathtubs) - we were advised that EVERY room has a bathtub - excellent, so we booked.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We arrived all the way from New Zealand (19 hours of flight-time) at approximately 11:00pm to arrive to a major disappointment.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We phoned the desk from our room and were advised \"sorry, there's nothing we can do as all rooms with a bathtub are taken\".FO</td></tr><tr><td>Then my husband went downstairs and spoke to the \"duty manager\" who then finally relented and looked up to see who would be checking out the following morning so we could get a room with a bathtub.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We were then promised a room with a bathtub by 12:00 midday, but by the next morning, the woman at the desk advised \"sorry, but they are now checking out at 4:00pm\", so we asked for a refund for the first day since the whole inconvenience had ruined a whole entire travel day (WE had been trying to sort out this mess OURSELVES all night long and the following morning by arranging a room with a bathtub) - their reply \"sorry, there's nothing I can do\" - she didn't even offer any complimentary gestures as a way of saying sorry for the inconvenience caused by this ridiculous hotel!FO</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel is so small and running on a strictly cheap budget that there is no doorman in the morning upon check-out.FO</td></tr><tr><td>It has been two days since we checked out and yes, we are still itching like crazy!FO</td></tr><tr><td>We have stayed in the W, Waldorf, Ritz, etc... and the service is excellent.FO</td></tr><tr><td>When getting out of the taxi, we had our bags taken care of right away and directed towards the check in counter.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We had no problems at check in, and received a complimentary room upgrade which was a pleasant surprise.FO</td></tr><tr><td>From that moment on after check in to our departure, all the staff were attentive, and knew our names, or took the time to introduce themselves.FO</td></tr><tr><td>As previous posters have said, the rooms aren't super big, but this being NYC, this was expected, but the room was gorgeous.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Had a chance to use the pool, and gym facilities, which were adequate, but they were working with the space they had.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I would say yes because of the excellent service, and the upgrade.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I was amazed, everything looked brand new.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room was very spacious with a generously proportioned bathroom.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff were very helpful and check-in/out was a very swift process.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We paid £148 per room per night which is fairly pricey, but I didn't feel like I'd been short changed.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My one issue with the hotel was the wi-fi access.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Supposedly free, but we never managed to get it working.FO</td></tr><tr><td>You have to fill in your details and wait for an email which gives you the necessary login details.FO</td></tr><tr><td>5 months later, the email still hasn't arrived...FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff, cleanliness and comfort gets better with every stay.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are well appointed and definitely \"cozy\" - small but that's fairly typical for the age and location.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff is very welcoming and concierge Vanessa is knowledgeable and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My business takes me there often, I arrive with chocolates, flowers and a hand written note from the Management.FO</td></tr><tr><td>No request is denied, there is a sense of old world service which at most hotels are a thing of the past, well 5 Star Service is alive and well here.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Excelent hotel, staff, location and accomodations.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Expectacular view to Central Park from rooms.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Service was incredible.FO</td></tr><tr><td>If you ask something by phone, concierge send someone that arrives to your room in less than two minutes to solve the problem.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I had never seen a fast and efficient service.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Great staffFO</td></tr><tr><td>Thanks to all the staff at San Carlos.FO</td></tr><tr><td>When we arrived the staff was very welcoming and took our bags up to our room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room and bathroom was very small; however, this was to be expected for NYC.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was very friendly and answered any questions we had including the fastest way to get to a particular place.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The check-in and check-out was a very smooth process and did not take long at all !FO</td></tr><tr><td>It was a great location,and the staff is so professional and met our every wish.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The front desk and hospitality staff were very welcoming.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room was a little small, but not unexpected in NY.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The lobby area is small, but with gorgeous Art Deco.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms at the Chatwal aren't super big, but this is NYC and this is a retro location, so I didn't expect massive space.FO</td></tr><tr><td>What they lack in size, they make up for in appointments.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our room was facing the alley, so nothing great on the view.FO</td></tr><tr><td>But the room was nice enough that it didn't matter.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Service was great as well.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Did have a bad situation, which highlights the excellence of the service.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We'd been given a room with a connecting door.FO</td></tr><tr><td>After the first night, we complained to the desk and they gave us a new room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We went out for the day and when we came back, they'd packed all of our things and moved them for us.FO</td></tr><tr><td>And they were thorough--they even found the charger my husband had left plugged into the wall.FO</td></tr><tr><td>So have to give them credit for the assist.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel does not have a grand entrance, however once inside it's art deco style embraces you.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our room was upgraded on the basis we had to wait 10 minutes to check in, it was not expected but welcome all the same as were the complimentary cocktails.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room was superb and I cannot fault it.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The reservation manager DERYK is so pleasant and kind and helpful!!FO</td></tr><tr><td>He is one of the many reasons that i will be loyal to this hotel!!FO</td></tr><tr><td>Very helpful staff who are always there to help!!FO</td></tr><tr><td>I arrived to the hotel greeted by warm welcoming employees, My personal assistant Helped me what whatever i need, and when i say whatever i mean whatever.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They helped me get reservations at places that took months to get in on.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff at the spa Jason and Cynthia were welcoming relaxing made us feel like we made the right choice just off the welcome we got.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They did not rush us to fill out out paper work or to the treatment, they made us a glass of wine just for it being our Anniversary a few weeks ago, to me that was amazing i would never expect such professionalism and kindness out of a spa before.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The location was superb.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We were within walking distance to my favorite NYC places including Ktown, Central Park, and 5th Ave.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our suite was HUGE especially for NYC.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The service was great.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Unfortunately, the rooms are uncomfortably furnished and almost useless to work or read in.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We got a 1 BR suite, which worked out fine for our group of 3 on a girls' trip.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was very nice and responded quickly to requests for more towels, etc.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The only issue we had was that one night there was a late concert going on at the Beacon Theater next door and from our room we could hear the music.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our room was on 21st floor, and we compromised some space and bed size (we had initially been allocated 11th fl) for a fantastic view; and far more natural light.FO</td></tr><tr><td>And the information given out by the concierge regarding half tix booth downtown was incorrect.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We booked the 1 bedroom, 2 double bed room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room was HUGE, very clean and we had a great view.FO</td></tr><tr><td>No complimentary wireless internet - For the amount of money we paid, it would have been nice to have access to wifi, even if we had to sit in the lobby or something to get it.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They have the option of around $10 per day to get wireless in the room, or you could go to the computer room which only had 2 computers in it (and it was always full).FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff were extremely friendly (especially the door men, who would happily stand and have a chat while we were waiting for a taxi), the room was lovely and it's in a great spot (walking distance to Times Square or easy access to the subway for those who don't want to walk).FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our room was bigger than expected and quiet.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff at this location is phenomenal and extremely personable.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Stayed 1 night in room 207.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Some of the staff were helpful, some not so much.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff are all very friendly and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The executive lounge is very large and has great views of the downtown skyline.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Kim and Jacques, your caring, attention to detail and desire to accommodate is beyond compare.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I have to admit, I have stayed here before and had a couple of concerns, but when I brought these to Jacques attention, they were corrected immediately!FO</td></tr><tr><td>The lobby is clean, the staff at the front desk have always been friendly.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff at this hotel makes it a excellent rating.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I must say that the staff though is supurb starting with the hotel manager Latonya, she goes above and beyond to make all of our stay here the best it can be.FO</td></tr><tr><td>This trickles down to the rest of the staff including all the front desk help, to the maids, as well as the maintance staff, all eager to help if something occurs.FO</td></tr><tr><td>When you stay at the Sherry Netherlands, all the staff do their utmost to make you feel at home!FO</td></tr><tr><td>The bellman, the elevator operator, the concierge, ... are very kind, helpful and efficient.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Rather than give you two weeks of examples of the poor service we received, I will list just a few, remembering we are paying $700+ per night, it was $635 and then you add all the taxes.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Before I start with the negatives, the reason for my heading is that Sherry lacks a lot of services that a hotel has, for example, there is no lounge to go sit in, read and watch the world go by.FO</td></tr><tr><td>For two weeks I was able to watch how the staff treat the hotel guests versus the residents of the building and it is very different, in fact, we felt like we were imposing and intruding, we did not feel like hotel guests.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The concierge’s were polite but they had this underlying tone and attitude.FO</td></tr><tr><td>So we arrive at the Sherry and are greeted by Alvin who collects our bags.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Alvin takes us up to our room and we step out to renovations occurring on the second floor, which is where our room is.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The concierge forgot to inform us of this when checking in.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Alvin points out that the Business Centre is closed for renovation and lucky for us they have relocated it right next door to our room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Alvin shows us our room, we tip him and he stated that he is a native New Yorker and if we need anything he is around – we never saw Alvin again until check out two weeks later when he picked up our bags.FO</td></tr><tr><td>There were also two notes from the management.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We certainly noticed the difference when we checked in at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills after staying at the Sherry – now there is a hotel!FO</td></tr><tr><td>I will say that Fernando, the doorman was extremely polite and very helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I was greeted curb side by the doorman who took my suitcase right to the front desk.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The front desk staff was terrific.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Check in was easy and they upgraded my room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room was really more of a suite.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Room size was great for traveling with two kids.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Pleasant front desk and housekeeping staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Friendly staff and SPACIOUS room!FO</td></tr><tr><td>We rented an executive suite which was a living room, bedroom and small kitchen, complete with dishware, mini fridge and microwave.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Staff - the nicest staff that never changes and always happy to assist the guests in any way they can.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Despite the rather nondescript frontage, the Iroquois is one of the best hotels we have stayed at in N.Y..FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our room was excellent, (although the bathrooms are a little on the small side), the staff are wonderfully friendly and helpful k but the best thing is the location- a few minutes walk from Times Square.FO</td></tr><tr><td>High praise to all of the wonderful staff who made us feel so very welcome!FO</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent in all respects...room a bit small but thats Manhattan.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Concierge Vanessa was delightful and got us great tickets to theatre.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel staff are very helpful and provided us with local tips for eating and drinking in the area.FO</td></tr><tr><td>If you require a quiet room, I would recommend asking for a room at the back of the hotel.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Even though you do not get the skyline view of the Empire State building, you will have a better night's sleep as 6th Avenue is always busy with traffic.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our room facing 44th Street was a good size for a New York hotel near Times Square.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was all very friendly and accommodating.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We were given an upgrade and had a spacious Junior Suite that was absolutely beautiful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff is unfailingly polite and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The service was excellent and staff were very friendly and remembered our names right away.FO</td></tr><tr><td>This is NYC though so the room is understandably small, and a bit worn.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Matt at the front desk is THE MAN.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Not sure if we were going to spend the night in the city, we walked in off the street & asked about available rooms.FO</td></tr><tr><td>After discussing prices & options, Matt took our number & called us when our room was ready, which ended up being MUCH nicer than I even expected (1bd suite; absolutely amazing.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Refreshing and tilted so you can look straight down at the ground below.FO</td></tr><tr><td>It was a lovely one-bedroom apartment (as opposed to hotel suite).FO</td></tr><tr><td>But there was no internet for half the stay.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Half the time I called down to the front desk there was no answer.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was not up to a 5 star hotel.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms/apartments were first rate.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room was pleasant, oversized and the bathroom was great.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I'd suggest to tip the bellman generously because it is the bellman who controls who uses the service.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The personal assistant was also helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My room was superb.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Very tall ceiling and very large by any standard.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Views of the library.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The work area is very useful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I did not have a lot of interaction with the staff but everyone seemed pleasant and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I never got the feeling that the staff was trying to be anything other than service oriented.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I will say there wasn't anyone to help open the door, but after walking from Penn Station with luggage I managed fine on my own.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The check-in was not just smooth...I was granted such a huge room upgrade that I was embarrassed.FO</td></tr><tr><td>While accompanying me upstairs to see \"if I would approve of the room,\" I was basically drooling at the sheer enormity of the room, two large bedrooms, an ample living-dining area, a generous balcony, and the two baths were straight out of a palace.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The high floor enabled me to leave the windows (which are also the walls) without the shades covering at night, so I could take in the spectacular views (NY Public Library, Empire State Building, etc.)FO</td></tr><tr><td>Plus, the view of NYC from my bed!FO</td></tr><tr><td>Checkout went without a hitch (4 PM, as per diamond benefits), and I was sure sorry to leave!FO</td></tr><tr><td>Our room was very quiet with no view, but we did not care since we were running around all over NYC on Thanksgiving weekend.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Very accommodating staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We have stayed in both the regular rooms with kitchen and the suites.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms are large for NYC, nicely appointed and clean.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Very friendly and helpful staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>- Extremely friendly hotel staff, very welcoming and even printed off directions to attractions we were interested inFO</td></tr><tr><td>- Our family of 4 shared one room with 2 queen sized beds.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They immediately came to assemble the crib for my 1 year old daughter.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are spacious and comfortable.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was great as well.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are typical of recently renovated Hilton hotels.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Huge rooms and bathrooms, executive lounge is a long way from some of the executive rooms.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Hilton need to get with the times and stop charging for wifi access.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We checked in early and they were able to find us a room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We had trouble with the wifi and they were on that too.FO</td></tr><tr><td>When our cruise was delayed today and we requested late check out, they have us until 3pm.FO</td></tr><tr><td>No free Wi-Fi.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Rooms were comfortable, staff all friendly, convenient to Hobby Airport.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The hallways are long here.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Quick easy check in, quicker checkout.FO</td></tr><tr><td>All staff were friendly and full of smiles.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The only item of note is that it is starting to show its age a bit, and the hot water control was basically on-off.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Nothing fancy about the room but it's functional and always as expected.FO</td></tr><tr><td>(I consider it to be better than IHOP or Denny's)FO</td></tr><tr><td>I do a lot of work on internet.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Fast and free internet connection here for me is a big plus.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My last speedtest in July 2012 showed 9.40 Mbps up and 6.46 Mbps.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I'd like to extend my thanks to Mngr.FO</td></tr><tr><td>La Tonya, who made sure that everything was working in my room and int tip-top shape.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Especially during renovation when all of the staff were too busy to fix my sink, she tried to fix it herself and needless to say she made an attempt.FO</td></tr><tr><td>A big thanks to Sal and the entire front office, y'all are always attentive and friendly.FO</td></tr><tr><td>LaTonya and her staff are very friendly,efficient,attentive, and very helpful and resource.FO</td></tr><tr><td>While everything else was fine, I do book hotel rooms to sleep in.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Every room has a few flaws that can be overlooked this took it from very good to average.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I would have let them know if asked how my stay was but the young lady that check-ed me out did not seem that interested.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Manager LaTonya is wonderful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>She Is very accommodating and friendly.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I have been here over a year and have never had a problem that wasn’t resolved in a very short period of time.FO</td></tr><tr><td>First my room was not ready, I know check in is at 3 and I arrived 10 minutes till' 3 they made me wait un til after 3pm & I was running late to a meeting because of them.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Next they finally put me in a room and it turned out to be a regular room when I had payed for a suite.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They sent the nice bellman back up and changed our room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff was okay, some were friendlier than others.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are spacious and have lots of character.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The front desk staff is very friendly.FO</td></tr><tr><td>A neat feature of this hotel is that it offers a free shuttle within a five mile radius.FO</td></tr><tr><td>One suggested to us by staff was Macondo on Congress - great, diverse menu and an awesome place for breakfast!FO</td></tr><tr><td>On checkout Monday, we had a 6:45 am cab to get to the airport.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We booked a suite on the Pent House floor on our wedding night.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Yes, we were staying across the hall from a loud drunken open house party!FO</td></tr><tr><td>The music was loud, the people were in and out of the suite causing a big disturbance in our suite.FO</td></tr><tr><td>At 12:30am when we couldn't take anymore we checked out and found another hotel.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The attendant at the front desk was considerate and understanding as we conveyed the issues and didn't charge us for the room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Great staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Thanks to HHonors, we were upgraded to a Jr. Suite for a minimal fee, which was very comfortable and spacious.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are some of the best appointed that I have come in contact with.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff is incredibly attentive and the area is wonderfully quiet.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Located on the campus, it is a very nice hotel, with specious modern room, and young, friendly staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Internet worked flawless.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Questions, requests, everything was answered and addressed right away.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Cabs are hailed upon request and elevator operators add a sense of bygone times.FO</td></tr><tr><td>As such the staff is small and they know who you are.FO</td></tr><tr><td>It was huge compared to other places I've stayed in NYC.FO</td></tr><tr><td>My only disappointment was that no welcome basket was waiting for my grandson.FO</td></tr><tr><td>We arrived with a rental car at 8am and we were pleasantly surprised to find a parking right next door to the hotel.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The person at the reception was very nice and even if we had booked the hotel the night to come, she offered us to go and take the complementary breakfast in the lobby.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The room was supposed to be ready at 3pm but as it was ready before, we were able to go to our room at midday.FO</td></tr><tr><td>What brings me back for so long is the fabulous service and value.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Mary at the front desk has been there longer that I have been going there.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The entire staff is very attentive.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The place is super clean, the staff helpful and the pool very nice.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The only thing we would like to see is the availability of at least a few larger rooms.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The executive lounge is on the top floor of the hotel and overlooks the entire ciy, they are very customer focused.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The friendly staff,clean rooms, nice facilities, great food, were such a warm welcome I hope to go back for fun travel.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms are large with the usual Hilton amenities.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel offers wifi for a fee.FO</td></tr><tr><td>One of the advantages of booking on the executive level is free internet.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Every single staff person I encountered was very friendly and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Check-out - receptionist didn't make eye contact or acknowledge me so dropped the key and left even though she was just writing something.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Again as I passed reception, I sometimes felt like I was breaking into a conversation - this sort of behaviour needs work.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Management - please try to comment in plain and clear English, I have read many of the responses and often have no idea what you're trying to say - still not sure if your last response to me was some kind of put-down or if you really intended doing something different based on my feedback, thanks for a nice stay again this time.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The general manager Ken, chef Damon, bartender Jason, the front desk guys and gals - all of them were great and went out of their way to make my stay as pleasant as possible.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I was most impressed the day that I had to go to the urgent care clinic, left my phone there, and a front desk gal hopped into the Hilton van and retrieved it for me; I was so grateful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The location is nothing special, but the building is well maintained, very quiet, and the staff is friendly.FO</td></tr><tr><td>LaTonya Campbell front desk personal Manuel, Meribel and Sal who always has a smile.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I walked in and was greated with a smiling face.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They were kind enough to take all my information, and put myself and my coworker in a room.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They just asked once power was on to come back so they could get a copy of our ID's.FO</td></tr><tr><td>They were courtious enough to call a day ahead and make sure we had enough nights due to the nature of our travels.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I would have given this hotel 3 stars or less if it hadn't been for the good customer service of the daytime hotel manager.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Staff were friendly and helpful.FO</td></tr><tr><td>I called the front desk and they indicated the person above me had \"probably left the shower door open\" - causing the overflow of water.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The front desk said the day manager would make things right in the morning.FO</td></tr><tr><td>After calling the front desk, the manager offered to reduce my bill by over 50% which I thought was a generous and acceptable remedy to the situation.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Erica was very hospitable and spoke to everyone entering the establishment.She helped us with any question we had concerning everything from room service to attractions in the Houston area.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Service was great.FO</td></tr><tr><td>very nice modern hotel lobby, dark wood (seems to be a big theme in houston).FO</td></tr><tr><td>Mostly friendly staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel shuttle took us to the Toyota Center for a concert and picked us up promptly.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff seemed professional and friendly.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The facilities are beautiful, though I agree with other reviewers that the build out was lacking in quality.FO</td></tr><tr><td>With that said, request to be put in a room away from the very loud construction happening directly adjacent to the building.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff at Sorella, while pleasant, seem ill-trained for the \"high end boutique\" that Sorella is marketed as.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Friendly and helpful staff.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Live music played on the weekend in the shared courtyard.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The rooms look to have been recently redone, and are attractive and comfortable.FO</td></tr><tr><td>Some renovation was ongoing in the area containing offices/meeting rooms, and our meeting room was nothing special, so maybe they are working to update that part of the hotel next.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The hotel wireless didn't work well for me, but the University's wireless network was a perfect substitute.FO</td></tr><tr><td>The staff are mostly
